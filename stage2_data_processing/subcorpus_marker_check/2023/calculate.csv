,"Product Carbon Footprint Management Upon establishing a comprehensive low-carbon action plan, we regularly calculate and verify the carbon emissions from our products and operations to ensure that the specific actions achieve the expected results."
,"The formula used to calculate the main GHG emissions from fossil fuel consumption CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion fuel consumption x low level heat generation x carbon content per unit calorific value x fuel carbon oxidation rate x 44 12, while the calculation of refrigerant emissions data refers to How to prepare an ESG Report Appendix 2 Reporting Guidance on Environmental KPIs issued by the HKEX, and the corresponding emission factors refer to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)."
