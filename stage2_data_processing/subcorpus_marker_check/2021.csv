Following the internationally accepted COSO1 risk management framework, the Company established a risk- oriented, closed- loop management model of risk identification first, business self- management, audit supervision and follow- up based on the operating and management needs of Mengniu. This incorporates risk management into business and applies to the business management process and gives full play to its value. Mengniu has established the Mengniu Risk Management System and six implementation rules on risk identification, risk evaluation, risk response, risk monitoring, risk response appraisal and risk management report. In 2021, the Company optimised the Mengniu Risk Management Framework and Manual for Risk Management of the Group on this basis, to ensure the effective operation of the risk management system. Mengniu has put in place three lines of defence of risk management organisation structure under the leadership of the Board. The Risk Management Committee is the highest deliberative and decision- making body for risk management, in which the chief executive officer of the Group serves as the chairman, and the vice president of the Group who is in charge of risk control and auditing business serves as the deputy chairman, while the committee members comprise the head of the major business divisions and functional departments. The Risk Management Department is the body for daily affairs designated by the Risk Management Committee that reports the management and control of important risks and the operational effectiveness of the risk management system to the Audit Committee under the Board every year on a regular basis, and under the supervision of the Audit Committee. In 2021, the Company organised business departments and functional departments to adopt a three- level evaluation method of self- identification of major business, professional pre- judgment and control of TOP20 risks, and collective review of Risk Management Committee focusing on formulating a new Mengniu strategic plan and key work goals, and assess major risks from the seven aspects of group strategy, market, finance, operation, law and compliance, quality and food safety, sustainable development on which the Risk Management Committee reached a consensus.

Following the internationally accepted COSO1 risk management framework, the Company established a risk- oriented, closed- loop management model of risk identification first, business self- management, audit supervision and follow- up based on the operating and management needs of Mengniu. This incorporates risk management into business and applies to the business management process and gives full play to its value. Mengniu has established the Mengniu Risk Management System and six implementation rules on risk identification, risk evaluation, risk response, risk monitoring, risk response appraisal and risk management report. In 2021, the Company optimised the Mengniu Risk Management Framework and Manual for Risk Management of the Group on this basis, to ensure the effective operation of the risk management system. Mengniu has put in place three lines of defence of risk management organisation structure under the leadership of the Board. The Risk Management Committee is the highest deliberative and decision- making body for risk management, in which the chief executive officer of the Group serves as the chairman, and the vice president of the Group who is in charge of risk control and auditing business serves as the deputy chairman, while the committee members comprise the head of the major business divisions and functional departments. The Risk Management Department is the body for daily affairs designated by the Risk Management Committee that reports the management and control of important risks and the operational effectiveness of the risk management system to the Audit Committee under the Board every year on a regular basis, and under the supervision of the Audit Committee. In 2021, the Company organised business departments and functional departments to adopt a three- level evaluation method of self- identification of major business, professional pre- judgment and control of TOP20 risks, and collective review of Risk Management Committee focusing on formulating a new Mengniu strategic plan and key work goals, and assess major risks from the seven aspects of group strategy, market, finance, operation, law and compliance, quality and food safety, sustainable development on which the Risk Management Committee reached a consensus. In order to promote the effective implementation of major risk management and control, and clarify main responsible department and person, Mengniu implements the accountability system. The risk management department has formulated appropriate risk response strategies, measures or contingency plans and follow- up to supervise the response effect in the process of classification, to reduce and avoid the adverse impact of important risks on the Group's strategic goals and sustainable development in an effective manner. 1 COSO Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway CommissionThree Lines of Defences of Risk Management Organisation Structure Business divisions The first line of defence The second line of defence The third line of defenceRisk Management Committee, Risk Management Department and functional departments of the GroupThe Internal Audit Department and the Discipline Inspection Department Respondent and main responsible person of riskPlanners and supervisors of risk managementAppraiser of risk management effectivenessMengniu has taken multiple measures at four levels to carry out empowerment training on risk management concepts and methods, promoted the extensive implementation of risk management mechanisms, and improved employees' risk management awareness and prevention and control standards, gradually cultivating a risk culture, and reasonably ensuring the achievement of strategic goals.

Training on basic norms of internal control 17 sessions of training on internal control were organised to consolidate the theoretical foundation of risk management personnel and grass- roots management personnel, more than 2, 500 personnel participated online and offline, and the Worth- It platform was launched with clicks exceeding 80, 000; Training on professional knowledge of risk management Based on the training needs of each unit, a total of more than 380 people from China Shengmu, Fuyuan Farming, and China Dairy Industrial Park have been offered risk empowerment training.

The Risk Management Department is the body for daily affairs designated by the Risk Management Committee that reports the management and control of [important] risks and the operational effectiveness of the risk management system to the Audit Committee under the Board every year on a regular basis, and under the supervision of the Audit Committee. In 2021, the Company organised business departments and functional departments to adopt a three- level evaluation method of self- identification of major business, professional pre- judgment and control of TOP20 risks, and collective review of Risk Management Committee focusing on formulating a new Mengniu strategic plan and key work goals, and assess major risks from the seven aspects of group strategy, market, finance, operation, law and compliance, quality and food safety, sustainable development on which the Risk Management Committee reached a consensus. In order to promote the effective implementation of major risk management and control, and clarify main responsible department and person, Mengniu implements the accountability system. The risk management department has formulated appropriate risk response strategies, measures or contingency plans and follow- up to supervise the response effect in the process of classification, to reduce and avoid the adverse impact of [important] risks on the Group's strategic goals and sustainable development in an effective manner. 1 COSO Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway CommissionThree Lines of Defences of Risk Management Organisation Structure Business divisions The first line of defence The second line of defence The third line of defenceRisk Management Committee, Risk Management Department and functional departments of the GroupThe Internal Audit Department and the Discipline Inspection Department Respondent and main responsible person of riskPlanners and supervisors of risk managementAppraiser of risk management effectivenessMengniu has taken multiple measures at four levels to carry out empowerment training on risk management concepts and methods, promoted the extensive implementation of risk management mechanisms, and improved employees' risk management awareness and prevention and control standards, gradually cultivating a risk culture, and reasonably ensuring the achievement of strategic goals.

Following the internationally accepted COSO1 risk management framework, the Company established a risk- oriented, closed- loop management model of risk identification first, business self- management, audit supervision and follow- up based on the operating and management needs of Mengniu. This incorporates risk management into business and applies to the business management process and gives full play to its value. Mengniu has established the Mengniu Risk Management System and six implementation rules on risk identification, risk evaluation, risk response, risk monitoring, risk response appraisal and risk management report. In 2021, the Company optimised the Mengniu Risk Management Framework and Manual for Risk Management of the Group on this basis, to ensure the effective operation of the risk management system. Mengniu has put in place three lines of defence of risk management organisation structure under the leadership of the Board. The Risk Management Committee is the highest deliberative and decision- making body for risk management, in which the chief executive officer of the Group serves as the chairman, and the vice president of the Group who is in charge of risk control and auditing business serves as the deputy chairman, while the committee members comprise the head of the major business divisions and functional departments. The Risk Management Department is the body for daily affairs designated by the Risk Management Committee that reports the management and control of important risks and the operational effectiveness of the risk management system to the Audit Committee under the Board every year on a regular basis, and under the supervision of the Audit Committee. In 2021, the Company organised business departments and functional departments to adopt a three- level evaluation method of self- identification of major business, professional pre- [judgment] and control of TOP20 risks, and collective review of Risk Management Committee focusing on formulating a new Mengniu strategic plan and key work goals, and assess major risks from the seven aspects of group strategy, market, finance, operation, law and compliance, quality and food safety, sustainable development on which the Risk Management Committee reached a consensus. In order to promote the effective implementation of major risk management and control, and clarify main responsible department and person, Mengniu implements the accountability system. The risk management department has formulated appropriate risk response strategies, measures or contingency plans and follow- up to supervise the response effect in the process of classification, to reduce and avoid the adverse impact of important risks on the Group's strategic goals and sustainable development in an effective manner. 1 COSO Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway CommissionThree Lines of Defences of Risk Management Organisation Structure Business divisions The first line of defence The second line of defence The third line of defenceRisk Management Committee, Risk Management Department and functional departments of the GroupThe Internal Audit Department and the Discipline Inspection Department Respondent and main responsible person of riskPlanners and supervisors of risk managementAppraiser of risk management effectivenessMengniu has taken multiple measures at four levels to carry out empowerment training on risk management concepts and methods, promoted the extensive implementation of risk management mechanisms, and improved employees' risk management awareness and prevention and control standards, gradually cultivating a risk culture, and reasonably ensuring the achievement of strategic goals.

Following the internationally accepted COSO1 risk management framework, the Company established a risk- oriented, closed- loop management model of risk identification first, business self- management, audit supervision and follow- up based on the operating and management needs of Mengniu. This incorporates risk management into business and applies to the business management process and gives full play to its value. Mengniu has established the Mengniu Risk Management System and six implementation rules on risk identification, risk evaluation, risk response, risk monitoring, risk response appraisal and risk management report. In 2021, the Company optimised the Mengniu Risk Management Framework and Manual for Risk Management of the Group on this basis, to ensure the effective operation of the risk management system. Mengniu has put in place three lines of defence of risk management organisation structure under the leadership of the Board. The Risk Management Committee is the highest deliberative and decision- making body for risk management, in which the chief executive officer of the Group serves as the chairman, and the vice president of the Group who is in charge of risk control and auditing business serves as the deputy chairman, while the committee members comprise the head of the major business divisions and functional departments. The Risk Management Department is the body for daily affairs designated by the Risk Management Committee that reports the management and control of important risks and the operational effectiveness of the risk management system to the Audit Committee under the Board every year on a regular basis, and under the supervision of the Audit Committee. In 2021, the Company organised business departments and functional departments to adopt a three- level evaluation method of self- identification of major business, professional pre- judgment and control of TOP20 risks, and collective review of Risk Management Committee focusing on formulating a new Mengniu strategic plan and key work goals, and assess major risks from the seven aspects of group strategy, market, finance, operation, law and compliance, quality and food safety, sustainable development on which the Risk Management Committee reached a consensus. In order to promote the effective implementation of major risk management and control, and clarify main responsible department and person, Mengniu implements the accountability system. The risk management department has formulated appropriate risk response strategies, measures or contingency plans and follow- up to supervise the response effect in the process of classification, to reduce and avoid the adverse impact of important risks on the Group's strategic goals and sustainable development in an effective manner. 1 COSO Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway CommissionThree Lines of Defences of Risk Management Organisation Structure Business divisions The first line of defence The second line of defence The third line of defenceRisk Management Committee, Risk Management Department and functional departments of the GroupThe Internal Audit Department and the Discipline Inspection Department Respondent and main responsible person of riskPlanners and supervisors of risk managementAppraiser of risk management effectivenessMengniu has taken multiple measures at four levels to carry out empowerment training on risk management concepts and methods, promoted the extensive implementation of risk management mechanisms, and improved employees' risk management awareness and prevention and control standards, gradually cultivating a risk culture, and reasonably ensuring the achievement of strategic goals.

Following the internationally accepted COSO1 risk management framework, the Company established a risk- oriented, closed- loop management model of risk identification first, business self- management, audit supervision and follow- up based on the operating and management [needs] of Mengniu. This incorporates risk management into business and applies to the business management process and gives full play to its value. Mengniu has established the Mengniu Risk Management System and six implementation rules on risk identification, risk evaluation, risk response, risk monitoring, risk response appraisal and risk management report. In 2021, the Company optimised the Mengniu Risk Management Framework and Manual for Risk Management of the Group on this basis, to ensure the effective operation of the risk management system. Mengniu has put in place three lines of defence of risk management organisation structure under the leadership of the Board. The Risk Management Committee is the highest deliberative and decision- making body for risk management, in which the chief executive officer of the Group serves as the chairman, and the vice president of the Group who is in charge of risk control and auditing business serves as the deputy chairman, while the committee members comprise the head of the major business divisions and functional departments. The Risk Management Department is the body for daily affairs designated by the Risk Management Committee that reports the management and control of important risks and the operational effectiveness of the risk management system to the Audit Committee under the Board every year on a regular basis, and under the supervision of the Audit Committee. In 2021, the Company organised business departments and functional departments to adopt a three- level evaluation method of self- identification of major business, professional pre- judgment and control of TOP20 risks, and collective review of Risk Management Committee focusing on formulating a new Mengniu strategic plan and key work goals, and assess major risks from the seven aspects of group strategy, market, finance, operation, law and compliance, quality and food safety, sustainable development on which the Risk Management Committee reached a consensus. In order to promote the effective implementation of major risk management and control, and clarify main responsible department and person, Mengniu implements the accountability system. The risk management department has formulated appropriate risk response strategies, measures or contingency plans and follow- up to supervise the response effect in the process of classification, to reduce and avoid the adverse impact of important risks on the Group's strategic goals and sustainable development in an effective manner. 1 COSO Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway CommissionThree Lines of Defences of Risk Management Organisation Structure Business divisions The first line of defence The second line of defence The third line of defenceRisk Management Committee, Risk Management Department and functional departments of the GroupThe Internal Audit Department and the Discipline Inspection Department Respondent and main responsible person of riskPlanners and supervisors of risk managementAppraiser of risk management effectivenessMengniu has taken multiple measures at four levels to carry out empowerment training on risk management concepts and methods, promoted the extensive implementation of risk management mechanisms, and improved employees' risk management awareness and prevention and control standards, gradually cultivating a risk culture, and reasonably ensuring the achievement of strategic goals.

Training on basic norms of internal control 17 sessions of training on internal control were organised to consolidate the theoretical foundation of risk management personnel and grass- roots management personnel, more than 2, 500 personnel participated online and offline, and the Worth- It platform was launched with clicks exceeding 80, 000; Training on professional knowledge of risk management Based on the training [needs] of each unit, a total of more than 380 people from China Shengmu, Fuyuan Farming, and China Dairy Industrial Park have been offered risk empowerment training.
