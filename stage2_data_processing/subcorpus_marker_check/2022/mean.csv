,"Category SSP 1 Scenario SSP 5 Scenario Natural ecology 8Warming By 2040, global mean temperature will be risen by 1. 6 C compared with the pre- industrial period (2. 0 C by 2100)By 2040, global mean temperature will be risen by 1. 7 compared with the pre- industrial period (5. 2 by 2100) Sea level By 2040, sea level will be increased by 0. 1 meters compared with the pre-industrial period (0. 4 meters by 2100)By 2040, sea level will be increased by 0. 1 meters compared with the pre-industrial period (0. 7 meters by 2100) Extreme climate The frequency and intensity of extreme climate will be increased to a certain degreeThe frequency and intensity of extreme climate will be increased significantly Socioeconomic environmentClimate policy Several countries, regions and economies will issue progressively tighter low-carbon related policies and regulations, make long- term net zero emissions or carbon neutrality target commitments, and manage global environmental issuesDue to the influence of energy structure, policy, economy and other factors, countries are climate policy and management of local environmental issues Energy technology changes Reduce the use of fossil fuels and shift to renewable energy sourcesRely on fossil fuels without actively pursue alternative energy sources Land utilization Establish strict regulations to prevent behavior that may affect the environment and ecologyFormulate moderate regulations to gradually reduce the rate of deforestation Dietary habits Dietary preference is on less meat type diet Meaty dietRisk Risk Description Risk Response Acute physical risk Extremely cold weather The energy consumption of maintaining a constant temperature increase during the operation of the factory The energy consumption of maintaining the constant temperature environment of animals increases The cost related to the loss and maintenance of gas supply pipeline facilities increases The operation risk of field station operators and outdoor workers increases Formulating prevention and control measures for safety and supply risks in winter under extremely cold conditions Typhoon Severe damage to power or water supply facilities for production, causing some factories' production lines and other operations to stop operatingThe construction cost increase as factories and pastures are designed to cope with strong wind Problems such as raw milk sourcing and production interruption occur in the supply chain, and the Company involves in supply interruption, compensation and legal liability Formulating a typhoon emergency relief plan Raising the flood control steps to improve the ability to resist natural disasters Extreme precipitation and flooding The risk of flooding of pastures and factories located in low-lying areas increases The physical impact of extreme precipitation on animals in raw milk supply chain affects raw milk production and quality Causing serious damage to the facilities of the enterprise Formulating emergency rescue plans for flood control and lightning protection Interconnected with the urban management information platform, greatly improving the timeliness of information acquisition Predicting and managing extreme precipitation events in advance, taking precaution measures, and relocating milk sources Extremely hot weather May affect the water and electricity consumption of production factories interference with normal production Increased heat stress reaction in cattles leads to limited raw milk production and affects milk production and quality The difficulty of keeping raw milk fresh increases in the process of transportation The possibility of food contamination and food-borne diseases increases The operating cost of ventilation, refrigeration and air conditioning in the field station increases The risk of field station operators and outdoor workers increases Financial impact According to calculations, in 2022, Mengniu invested approximately RMB600, 000 in the use and rental of generators due to the shortage of electricity caused by the dry weather."
