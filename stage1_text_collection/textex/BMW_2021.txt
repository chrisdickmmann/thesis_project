ABOUT THIS REPORT
FUNDAMENTALS EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATIONPRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORKINTRODUCTIONINTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATIONPRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE 01 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 2021 was a stark reminder of the urgent need for us all to move towards a more sustainable way of living. COVID 19 and its effects remained per - vasive and we felt the increasingly devastating impact of climate change, which threatens biodiversity, ecosystems, natural balance, resources and livelihoods around the world. The businesses worldwide were also tested by numerous challenges, including the cost of raw materials, logistics disruption and the supply shortage of semiconductors. All of these point to the precipice upon which we now stand, and it is time to decide Do we continue as before, allowing our environment to succumb to the damage we are inflicting upon it, or do we take decisive actions now, to ensure that there will still be a habita - ble home for our future generations? For BMW Brilliance, the answer is clear. No Premium Without Sustainability As societies work towards a more sustainable economy, businesses also need to keep up with the sustainable development. The sustainability tar - gets of BMW Brilliance are aligned with BMW Group, and we fully support the Group's strategic objective to be the most sustainable manufacturer for individual premium mobility. For us, there is no premium without sustain - ability. Aswell as fostering a sustainability mindset among our employees and embedding sustainable practices throughout our organisation, we are driving industrywide changes by working together with our partners to build an endtoend sustainable value chain. A sustainable future is only possible when we are all pulling in the same direction.

FUNDAMENTALS EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATIONPRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORKINTRODUCTIONINTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATIONPRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE 02 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 Dr. Franz Decker President and CEO BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. Catalysing Climate Change Actions Taking actions against climate change is one of our top business priorities, and we are change agents to drive green transformation across our entire value chain, from production to supply chain, logistics and dealer management. We are proud to say that operating on renewable electricity has become a business norm within BMW Brilliance. We successfully transitioned to 100 renewable electricity not only for our production base in Shenyang (since 2019), but also for all our nonproduction sites across China in 2021. Together with the stateoftheart lowcarbon technologies in our production, we were able to reduce CO 2 emissions per vehicle produced year after year. To accel - erate sustainable transformation of our supply chain, we launched the Supply Chain Match Plan China, and one of the underlying ambitions are to enable our suppliers in Liaoning Province to transition to 100 renewable electricity by 2030. Likewise in our logistics operation, carbon reduction is a core mission under our new 2025 Aftersales Strategy, which has set ambitious targets to curb CO 2 emissions from aftersales logistics. On the customer end, we are striving to create a lowcarbon ecosystem along the customer journey. One landmark programme is the Network Transforma - tion Green Star Programme, which we are developing to enhance sustainable dealerships and services through four aspects green environment, green power, green operations, and green engagement. Over the course of this past year, we have continued to develop our charging infrastructure, making more renewable electricity available for our customers throughout the country. Accelerating Circularity Truly sustainable manufacturing cannot be achieved without circularity. At BMW Brilliance, we intensify circularity with our Secondary First approach, which is finding ways to reduce, reuse and recycle parts and materials used in our products and processes. In 2021, battery recycling and its subsequent secondary use was a major focus for us. And so, we have greatly enhanced the volume of highvoltage batteries (HVBs) recycled and identified secondary uses for HVB s for pallet trucks and as energy storage solutions in our plants, thereby extending their lifecycle. Extending Care to Biodiversity Biodiversity is the foundation of life on our planet, whom we treat as acritical stakeholder. Biodiversity conservation is vital to building an ecological civili - sation, thus fulfilling the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in this area is more important than ever. In 2021, we launched our BMW Beautiful Homeland Initiative a new and longterm BMW CSR programme that focuses on biodi - versity conservation and public education with full engagement of stakehold - ers. We are proud to be the first premium OEM to embrace and contribute to biodiversity conservation in China. We are also ingraining this philosophy in our facilities by establishing ecological gardens, sponge city concepts and imple - menting naturebased solutions to foster a better environment for our people and our planet. Priorities in 2022 At BMW Brilliance, we believe the spirit of sustainability and cooperation is the only way forward to resolve the global challenges today. This year we are scaling up for our next phase of growth by expanding our production footprint, deepening our local supplier network, and launching the new futureorientated models. By manufacturing more of our products in China, our biggest single market, we are adding more constructive values for the local economy and for our Chinese customers. Furthermore, our new production plants adhere to the BMW iFACTORY principles of Lean, Green and Digital, reflecting our deter - mination to move forward together with China. In 2022, we are not only excited to accelerate our own sustainable transformation, but also ready to lead the sustainable and highquality development of China's automotive industry. While circular processes are not new for us, we have made great strides in recent years by increasing the volume of materials we recycle, in particular with our closedloop system for steel and aluminium ingots. Another component in our push for sustainability is an expanded scope of partsreturns and reman - ufacturing, and further upgraded core tracing features for reverse logistics systems and improved overall partsmanufacturing capability. Our efforts have resulted in more efficient manufacturing, requiring fewer primary materials, and reducing our overall environmental impact. Today we must regard carbon as the new currency and remain industry leader in promoting a sustainable and green economy, by engaging and collaborating with our partners across value chain.

BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE 11 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATIONPRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK THE CALL FOR CONCRETE ACTIONS In 2021, the world around us underwent drastic changes. BMW Brilliance is aware of the changes taking place in the environment and is reflecting upon the impact that our business has on it. We recognise the social responsibility that we take on as a leading player in China's automotive industry, and as such we are optimising our business to enhance sustainability, identifying potential opportunities, and exploring new ideas and directions for further growth with sustainability in mind. The objective is for us to not only achieve growth in this industry but also create a prosperous planet for the generations tocome. We experienced worsening impacts of climate change, as we witnessed the floods caused by torrential rain in He - nan in 2021. Not only have these events caused adverse SUSTAINABILITY MEGATRENDS A company's success depends to a large extent on its ability to recognise changes in its business environment early on and make plans accordingly, so as to prevent damages from potential risks and seize opportunities. In 2021, we conducted various studies with qualitative and quantitative methodologies to analyse the sustainability megatrends around us, including the green power policy, biodiversity, climate risk and others. Based on the anal - ysis, we refined our sustainability focus to take proactive and futureproof actions. The purpose is to achieve not only growth in this industry, but also create a prosperous planet for the generations to come. 11 effects on our business, it has also inflicted pain on many lives and further slowing down the economy. Concur - rently, COVID 19 continues to afflict populations around the world and is impacting economic recovery, creating uncertainty for the future. Given the growing importance of biodiversity, more and more governments and corpo - rations are being called to take action. In these trying circumstances, the world is coming to - gether to combat these challenges. A progressive road map has been introduced in China as the country formal - ly commits to carbon neutrality by 2060, with a series of policies on energy transition, carbon market and circular economy coming up. Following the fruitful conclusion of COP 15 to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in Kunming, biodiversity was also put at the top of the agen - da for decisionmakers worldwide, including China. As a leader in sustainability in the Chinese automotive industry, BMW Brilliance is in a constant endeavour to improve our operations and adapt to external chang - es while responding to national strategies. We believe sustainable growth is the only path forward to guide us out of the challenges outlined above, and it is a path that holds great potential for growth. As part of our efforts to achieve sustainability, we are expanding our Emobility initiative, revolutionising traditional travel with lowcar - bon alternative methods. We are also making notable progress in transitioning our manufacturing and logistics processes to become low carbon, and advancing circu - larity across our entire value chain. What is more, we are actively utilising new technology such as 5 G, IoT, and AI in our push to fully digitalise our work and service. In do - ing so we are creating more possibilities to enhance our sustainability performance.

BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE 12 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATIONPRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS Carsten Mueller Deiters Head of Business Development and Corporate Sustainability With a converging focus, we are accelerating our step towards a more lowcarbon and circular development. In 2020, to achieve our goals set by the BMW Group as well as to better comply with national policies in China, we have redefined our three sustainability directions. Building on the foun - dations laid down in the previous year, in 2021, we looked to further enhance our responses towards internal and external changes. We firmly support the Paris Climate Agreement and are dedicated to achieving carbon reduction across our whole value chain. In 2021, with the launch of the new BMW iX 3 and scaling up of charging facilities, we boosted new energy vehicle (NEV) sales and facilitated convenient longdistance lowcarbon trav - el. Through our efforts, we have not only reached a milestone in using 100 renewable electricity in our production and nonproduction sites, but also paved the pathway for our dealers and business partners towards renewable electricity adoption through the BMW Green Power Alliance project. In utilising inno - vative methods to promote green logistics through the pilot use of ETrucks, LNG Trucks and the wider adoption of railway transportation, we have further accelerated lowcarbon transformation. 1 CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIONS Every stakeholder is a valued partner in realising our goals. Sided with stakeholders, in 2021, we worked on the most critical sustainability issues while maintaining our Quality First mindset to guide our quality management. We joined hands with our suppliers to explore and innovate on the use of secondary materials. One of our key accomplishments was to push ona more sustain - able dealer network through the Network Trans - formation Green Star Programme.

BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE 15 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATIONPRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE The BMW Brilliance Board of Management is at the core of our leadership. Under their guidance, we have integrated sustainability into key business decisions that direct our company forward. Sustainability is an in - tegral component in our annual targetsetting process, which defines the targets each business function is required to meet. This allows us to follow directives laid by the Board of Management in a systematic way that holds all business functions accountable. The Board of Management also oversees our compliance with all provisions of the law and internal regulations, aswell as implementing risk management and conducting risk control measures. Since its establishment in 2020, the BMW Brilliance Corporate Sustainability Execution Committee has been fulfilling its responsibility of ensuring transparen - cy and facilitating common understanding on overall sustainability progress and target status across our value chain. Through monthly meetings and continuous engagement, the committee steered the crossfunction communication and resource synergy, and promoted the sharing of insights, trends, and best practices to drive sustainability innovation and projects. ASSESSING AND MANAGING CLIMATE RISKS Faced with the severe impact of climaterelated disasters in 2021, we conducted a deepdive cli - materelated risk analysis based on Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Our aim is to minimise the adverse effects of climate change through risk management and become a more resilient mobility service provider. According to the TCFD, climaterelated risks can be divided into two major categories. The first category is transition risks, which are related to the transition toa lowercarbon economy with extensive policy, legal, technology, reputation and market changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements re - lated to climate change. The second category is phys - ical risks, which are related to the physical impacts of climate change and can be eventdriven (acute, like hurricanes and floods) or longerterm shifts (chronic, the rise of sea levels) in climate patterns. By conducting megatrend analysis, literature review and peer benchmarking, we have identified 3 tiers of key transition and physical climate change risks, including the increased severity of extreme weather events, shifts in consumer preferences and increased costs of GHG emissions. As a result, all risks were listed on the heatmap and integrated into the corpo - rate risk report for further evaluation. Our next step is to conduct a quantitative analysis of climaterelated risks to provide a more concrete financial reference for the strategy design and decision making. Jun Wang Senior Vice President Finance By assessing various emerging risks, including climate change's impact on our business, we are better prepared for the future by enhancing our resilience to potential extreme events.

DIALOGUE & ENGAGEMENT We maintain a close dialogue with local government, and regularly exchange opinions on critical economic, social and environmental issues. In February 2021, the previ - ous incumbent mayor of Shenyang Municipal People's Government, Mr. Wang Xinwei visited Plant Tiexi, and widely acknowledged BMW Brilliance's contributions to the local economy. In December 2021, at the Sustainabil - ity BMW Shenyang Plants event, our uptodate sus - tainability achievements and management approaches were presented to Shan Yi, Vice Mayor of Shenyang, Li Gang, Secretary of Dadong District CPC Committee, participating journalists and suppliers. We have long treated our suppliers as indispensable partners who enable us to realise a sustainable and cir - cular value chain. We regularly engage suppliers via joint conversations, exploring potential opportunities for both businessrelated issues as well as for greater sustainabil - ity in our operations. In June 2021, our key suppliers were invited to the German Association of the Automotive In - dustry Quality Management Centre (VDA QMC) Regional Conference, where we shared insights on achieving sus - tainable and highquality development in today's digital age. In addition, green transformation and sustainability were also highlighted during the BMW Brilliance Supplier Media Visit, where we presented the best sustainable practices to realise a sustainable supply chain. We also engage with other business leaders to enhance collaboration on sustainability issues. In June 2021, the BMW Brilliance BASF Tech Day was successfully held, with more than 1, 000 senior managers and industrial experts taking part. As a result, a further consensus on the continuing cooperation has been established in order to ensure longterm sustainable development for both sides. In the same month, the first Open World Event ended successfully with the guests attendances from Alibaba Group. This event allowed us to expand our hori - zons with the latest technological developments to better promote our digital transformation. Sustainability has always been a central theme when engaging with different stakeholders. By approaching and interacting with each stakeholder group in a tailormade fashion, we can understand their concerns and respond to their needs and expectations more efficiently. Regular communication with local authorities on focus topics through meetings with senior government officials, visits and management forums. Roundtables, lectures and discussions with experts, scholars and students; specialised and localised programmes, traineeships, and vocational education opportunities.

BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE 18 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATIONPRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK STAKEHOLDER COLLABORATION BMW Brilliance always strives to expand our sustaina - bility networks through widespread collaborations with partners from industry, supply chain, civil society and other areas. In this way, we are better able to leverage strengths from both sides to enhance overall sustainable development and ultimately create shared value. BMW Brilliance maintains a close relationship with the China Automotive Technology and Research Centre (CATARC), one of the Chinese automotive industry's leading associations. We actively participate in various events organised by CATARC to promote industrial tech - nological innovation, which directly drives the develop - ment of the automotive industry. In 2021, our excellent performance earned us CATARC recognition. BMW Brilliance was awarded the China New Car Assess - ment Programme (CNCAP) Safety Contribution Award by CATARC, and we have been continually ranked No. 1 on the Automotive Industry Green Development Index. In terms of our collaboration with civil society, based on our strong partnership with the China Education Devel - opment Foundation and China Green Foundation, we are exploring new areas while also addressing other emerging issues. In 2021, we launched the BMW Beau - tiful Homeland Initiative to expand our care and efforts towards biodiversity protection. We also upgraded the BMW JOY Home programme via a new Self Strength - ening Movement which focuses on the revitalisation of rural education. STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION BMW Brilliance strives to establish smooth communica - tions among all our employees while leveraging different communication channels to cultivate a sustainability mindset. In March 2021, we held a series of events in support of the Earth Hour 2021 initiated by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Our employees got a better un - derstanding of how to put the concept of sustainability into actual practice by turning off the electric devices, saving toiletries and driving in BMW models ECO PRO mode. In July 2021, the BMW Region China Joint Strat - egy Forum was successfully held, kicking off a series of communication programmes to ensure that all employ - ees fully understand the company's strategy in China towards 2025 and beyond. THE BMW GREEN POWER ALLIANCE Collaboration Initiative We initiated the BMW Green Power Alliance in 2021 to accelerate renewable electricity adoption across our entire value chain, including at our production, supply chain, dealerships and nonproduction sites. We have accomplished a feasibility study of different renewable electricity adoption solutions, such as the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), distributed solar, and the International Renewable Energy Certificates (IRECs). Furthermore, multiple workshops were held to help motivate and empower our business partners to transition to renewable electricity. In the fall of 2021, the workshop for dealer partners attracted over 150 participants from 104 dealer groups; whereas the workshop for nonproduction sites drew over 50 participants from real estate landlords, relevant business departments and facility operators. Following the workshop and training, pilot dealers and nonproduction sites were selected as the first group to adopt renewable electricity. In the future, we will develop practice manuals to provide professional guidance and technical support to our dealers and real estate partners on renewable electricity adoption.

BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE 20 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATIONPRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK TAKING A RISKBASED APPROACH BMW Brilliance has developed a hybrid methodol - ogy that combines both topdown and bottomup approaches to identify, assess, and mitigate any key compliance risks the company may face. Each year, the Corporate Governance and Compliance department summarises and assesses the overall status and re - ports it to management. The 2021 Compliance Risk As - sessment heat map shows increasing risk levels for the most compliance subjects, which is in line with today's stricter external regulatory environment. In response to this, a variety of mitigation measures were developed and implemented. As an integral part of an effective compliance man - agement system, the robust organisational frame - work of BMW Brilliance has ensured that a proper compliance accountability structure is put in place. A ROBUST GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE BMW Brilliance has established a robust organisational framework to ensure a proper compliance accounta - bility structure. The Board of Directors (BoD) of BMW Brilliance assumes the ultimate responsibility for ad - ministering a compliance management system at the shareholder level. The Audit and Compliance Commit - tee (AC) under the BoD sets compliance objectives, allocates resources and monitors practices to ensure complete compliance with all regulatory and ethical requirements. Authorised by the BoD, BMW Bril - liance s Board of Management (BoM) and Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee, serving as its subcommittee, takes the primary oversight role. Anda dedicated department of Corporate Governance and Compliance was established to manage overall com - pliance programmes. See Chapter 5. 2 Compliance Govern - ance for more description of our compliance governance process. COMPLIANCE GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT Given the uncertainties resulting from the COVID 19 pandemic and ever stricter regulatory requirements around the globe, placing integrity at the heart of our business strategy is not only a best practice, but also vital for our company's longterm survival. Since 2020, several compliance topics such as antitrust, cybersecurity and data security have been put at centre stage. The topic list may continue to grow and remain highly active in the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, a series of law enforcement moves in China has sent a powerful signal from top regulators about their determination to see tightened regulations are closely adhered to. At BMW Brilliance, a wellfunctioning and dynamic compliance management system has become increasingly important for the company's sustainable future success.

BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE 21 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATIONPRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK 2022 FORECAST Today's increasingly volatile, uncertain, and dynamic environment demands a robust compliance management system. Faced with a host of challenges, BMW Brilliance is actively taking systematic measures in a variety of com - pliance areas, with special attention to highrisk sectors. In terms of antitrust, we will continue to review and rein - force our antitrust management system as well as all per - tinent penalty mechanisms. The specific antitrust targets will be included as part of the overall 2022 compliance targets for all managers and antitrust compliance require - ments will be included in the job descriptions for relevant staff members. We explicitly prohibit certain misconducts related to transaction prices as well as gross profits on specific individual sales. GENERAL MEASURES - PREVENTION, DETECTION AND REMEDIATION BMW Brilliance regularly implements a wide range of prevention, detection, and remediation measures to manage its com - pliance risks. Furthermore, we regularly update our compliance management system to cope with the continually changing risk profiles of the company's businesses, environment, customers, laws, and standards. To prevent the initial emergence of any compliance issue, BMW Brilliance instils and promotes a culture of ethics and in - tegrity throughout the company. To this end, nine compliance speeches were delivered by BoM members during a variety of activities in 2021. This helped establish an ethical climate of corporate governance. A culture of compliance was also nurtured through compliance target, legal monitoring, policies, training, communication, and preapproval processes via the Ecompliance systems. BMW Brilliance uncovers potential compliance issues in several ways, including case investigations, special reviews, routine audits, and other methods. When problems are identified, we initiate disciplinary measures in a strict and consistent manner against those employees or business partners who have violated external regulations or internal policies. We strive to locate the root causes and work diligently to optimise the necessary controls and processes to minimise any risk of recurrence. One of the key components of compliance is to ensure the process of reporting compliance concerns is as easy as possible. To this end, there are a variety of ways to report compliance concerns at BMW Brilliance. In 2021, the company further officially promoted the BMW Group SpeakUP line to business partners. BMW Brilliance is fully committed to lawful and respon - sible business conduct, and we also demand high ethical standards from our business partners. That is why BMW Brilliance has taken and will continue to take necessary proactive and practical steps to foster our business part - ners active engagement in compliance management. By creating a culture of compliance across our entire supply chain, we will reinforce trust between BMW Brilliance and our business partners and maintain business rela - tionships in a stronger and more sustainable manner. Moreover, we will actively encourage business de - partments to take more proactive measures related to antifraud, including job rotation, and conflict of inter - est selfdeclarations. At the same time, we will initiate prudent measures to enhance the overall capacity and capabilities of forensic technology in investigation. While we have made steady progress on various issues, we must be fully aware that some compliance areas are still prone to misconduct and fraud. For this reason, the fight against noncompliance will remain a focal point for us in the foreseeable future. That is why we must practise constant vigilance and redouble our efforts to ensure thorough, effective and timely implementation of all compliance programmes and processes. 2021 BMW Brilliance Compliance Interface Ambassador Workshop.

We strictly comply with the recent changes in laws and regulations, including the Data Security Law of the People's Republic of China, the Personal Infor - mation Protection Law of the People's Republic of Chi - na (PIPL), and Several Provisions on the Management of Automobile Data Security (for Trial Implementation). To ensure that we have fulfilled the requirement of recent laws and regulations, we established a crossfunctional PIPL Taskforce to analyse the laws requirements, check our current status and risks, and formulate responding measures. In the long term, we will setup a PIPL Programme to focus on the PIPL and important vehicle data cross border. The programme will bring changes to our governance structure, where we have introduced 4 dedicated roles Cybersecurity Officer (CSO), Data Security Officer (DSO), Data Priva - cy Officer (DPO), and Automotive Data Security Officer (ADSO). Their responsibility is to manage personnel, processes, and automotive data by utilising a series of features that we have developed. DATA PRIVACY AND INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT Along with our perpetual pursuit of digitalisation, in - formation security is a fundamental component in our designs and is closely managed throughout the entire process. At all corporatelevel digitisation programmes, such as cloud transformation, 5 G IoT aswell as digital plant, our core focus is to ensure cybersecurity. Among all the digitalisation programmes initiated by different business units, we have designated a dedicated posi - tion, the Security Matter Expert, with a set of standard instructions to ensure information security across the entire digitisation process. INFORMATION SECURITY As information security is of the utmost importance to BMW Brilliance, we have ceaselessly strived to improve the security measures. This year we have been able to expand the scope of information security governance framework by incorporating individual applications from our business into our own governance framework. We have expanded the device network access control process and tools, and set up the production security process, which enhances the role and responsibilities of IT OT IoT security in the production process. We have passed ISO IEC 27001 certification. Fouryear achievement of Cybersecurity Law of China (CSL) Programme Action In 2017, we established the Cybersecurity Law of China (CSL) Programme to facilitate its implementation across all of BMW Brilliance.

Our implemented data security measures have fully com - plied with international data protection regulations and standards and have passed ISO IEC 27701. AWARENESS PROMOTION AND COMMUNICATION Internal communication is critical to ensure that we have complied with our privacy principles. As such, we have educated our employees to increase their infor - mation security and data privacy awareness through Elearning on BMW Brilliance's online training platform. We trained 100 of nonproduction employees on three main topics Data Privacy Protection, Fundamen - tals of Cybersecurity Law, and information protection. We have also initiated Cybersecurity Month at Plant Da - dong in 2021 to further raise security awareness, which will roll out to all plants in 2022. We have also been inactive contact with our communi - ty as well as regulators. As such, we have participated in discussions held by the National Information Security Standardization Technical Committee and provided insights and suggestions for standardisation from our corporate perspective. 2022 FORECAST Building on our achievements in 2021, we will continue to improve our information security and data use governance. We will work to enhance our cloud security in the coming year, and take more measures to safeguard the security of our production network. We are also looking to take the overall aware - ness from employees on the protection of in - formation security and data privacy to anew level. We recognise there is still much work to be done, so promoting the visualisation and automation of cybersecurity will be a major focus for us. Our aim is to create transparency related to subject data consent and custom - er inquiries, aswell as to enforce additional conditions for crossborder access. Ultimately, we want to restructure the role and responsi - bilities of data security and cyber security in response to shifts in the regulatory landscape. The protection of privacy and information is weaved into every facet of our business. It is the bond of trust shared between partners, customers and us. 2021 BMW Brilliance Cybersecurity Awareness Month at Plant Dadong. Alexander Angerbrandt Vice President Information Technology

As a corporate citizen of the planet, BMW Brilliance is an active leader in addressing the environmental problems caused by the battery. We have fully complied with all regulatory requirements related to HVB lifecycle management. All batteries are 100 traceable, collected and recycled by BMW. What'smore, we are currently pioneering various strategies for the secondary use of HVBs to expand their operational lifetimes to help contribute to the national agenda of establishing a circular economy. EXTENDING HVB LIFECYCLES Adhering to regulatory standards and requirements is of the utmost importance to BMW Brilliance. To ensure full compliance, we have appointed a dedicated team to manage the entire lifecycle of HVBs. In 2021, we recy - cled 6, 173 pieces of HVBs, a 42 increase from 2020. This was achieved through optimising our collection and recycling processes. To this end, we conducted training exercises with dealers to ensure that they maintain our standards when handling HVBs. We have also enhanced the recycling interface within Joy Chat to improve our dealer's user experience. BMW Brilliance's professional HVB Recycling Service outlet in Shanghai is currently en - joying successful operations, earning widespread praise and recognition from the local government. PIONEERING SECONDARY USE OF HVBS We have been focusing our efforts on pioneering R&Don secondary use scenarios for HVBs. Starting at our pro - duction plants, our first breakthrough was the pilot use of secondary HVBs to power our pallet trucks. In 2021, we used endoflife HVBs to power forklifts and pallet trucks atour Plant Tiexi and Plant Powertrain. After six months into the pilot scheme, these HVBs demonstrated out - standing power resilience and safety performance. We have also established a sustainability strategy for HVB disposal the closedloop concept, which involves the disposal oftest batteries and aftersales batteries. The goal is to effectively extract and put them into new battery pro - duction from 2022 onward. Key materials in HVBs nickel, cobalt, and lithium are then recycled into manufacturing new batteries. This process will ultimately help replace mined resources. We are currently working closely with our recycling partners and HVB suppliers to achieve the closedloop system for our HVBs in the future. By the end of 2021, 554 BMW dealers have established the recycling procedure for HVBs across China. Developing our battery recycling capabilities is at the forefront of our efforts to preserve the environment. Furthering HVB Research Through Cooperation with Tsinghua University Collaboration Over a twoyear period, we have partnered with Tsing - hua University on HVB market research, battery lifecy - cle carbon emission calculations, and reusable battery development. Based on a carbon emission LCA of BMW Brilliance's HVBs carried out in tandem with our partner, we were able to identify certain processes in the lifecycle where carbon emissions could be reduced. Ultimately, we will develop an application that analyses the overall health of an HVB based on its usage data, allowing us to utilise it in a variety of scenarios. Pilot use of endoflife HVBs to power pallet truck at our plant. Our second breakthrough was the pilot use of secondary HVB for energy storage at Plant Tiexi. Starting in 2021, we used retired HVBs to store and supply photovoltaic power to 3 directcurrent charging pillars in a pilot power storage station we created. The success of these pilot schemes was supported by adhering toa strict oper - ational process that ensured the safety and optimal performance of the HVBs. Further tests are ongoing to validate these programmes with the goal of scaling up for wider application.

We have been initiating different programmes to enhance the efficiency and usability of our current bins while also exploring the possibility of recycling and remanufacturing bins to achieve material circularity in our supply chain. STEEL BIN AND NONSTEEL BIN PROGRAMME We carried out an investigation into steel bins reuse for BMW X 1 with an aim to reduce costs, materials, and CO emissions. Our programme was initiated in March 2021 and completed by the end of 2021. A total of 1, 350 piec - es of steel bin can be reused in the next project. We also conducted a feasibility study on the use of nonsteel bins to evaluate the use of expanded polypropyl - ene (EPP) renewable material (from EOP bins and daily scrap material). This study led us toa conclusion that a ratio of 75 new material to 25 recycled material used in producing new bins will meet our required EPP bin functions. As a result, we are now in negotiations with our EPP supplier to conclude a recycling and trans - portation contract. MAXIMISING BIN USABILITY In addition to recycling and reuse of packaging ma - terials, we have improved upon BMW Brilliance's bin concept construction guidelines by incorporating a light bin design standard, which has greatly increased efficiency. 98. 2 of all local parts are now transport - ed via returnable packaging. Our binsharing and rental programme has achieved excellent results, with our top five parts suppliers making use of rental bins 35, 545 times in 2021. The current scope of applica - tions covers existing projects and will eventually be extended to new vehicle projects. In June 2021, we started a project to optimise pack - aging density that was completed at the end of 2021. The result is that Plant Tiexi has already achieved nearly 0. 101 m per car saving in packaging while Plant Dadong has saved approximately 0. 166 m per car. We have also published a CO emissions matrix on different package materials and provided guidance on the best material choices for the bin design. 2022 FORECAST In adherence to the requirements of the National Development and Reform Commission's 14 th Five Year Circular Economy Development Plan, BMW will develop and release more remanufactured parts categories applicable to the demand in the China market. This plan includes fulfilling a remanufactured product line of electronic steering gear while achiev - ing SOP for the remanufacturing extension of AC compressors. The plan also covers releasing remanufactured me - chatronics to fit on hybrid cars, and the beginning of using remanufactured engine components, alterna - tors, and head unit extensions. This plan will also im - prove the systematic solutions of core classifications and sorting standards. The results of the secondary utilisation pilot pro - grammes will be evaluated fora possible mass rollout. In 2022, with new requirements in place for recycling suppliers, we will form a closedloop of HVB recycling, which involves all recycled raw mate - rials being reused by our own suppliers. We will continue to work on capacity building for separating aluminium coils to enable a closedloop of raw materials. We will also conduct more tests to evaluate the performance of plastic parts and hope - fully achieve the start of mass production next year.

We also conduct WASTE CLASSIFICATION AND DISPOSAL Minimising waste across all operations is one of our top priorities. In this regard, we have repurposed endoflife materials in new ways by developing innovative approaches. About 170 t of iron sludge waste from Plant Powertrain is no longer landfilled, 99. 5 of which was recycled. By separating the amount of con - centrated grease oil generated in the pretreatment process of painting, the grease oil wastewater output is reduced by 71, and 120 t of harmful wastewater could be recycled this year. Thanks to the optimised sludge treatment facilities and processes at Shenyang Plants, the waste per vehicle produced we sent off for disposal in 2021 decreased from 2. 99 to 2. 50 kg. VOC EMISSIONS REDUCTION Since 2021, Plant Tiexi and Plant Dadong Extension Projects have completed the installation of stateoftheart volatile organic compounds (VOC) treatment facilities, which have made significant contributions towards VOC reduction. By the end of 2021, we have cut VOC emissions per vehicle produced by 76. LAND USE AND BIODIVERSITY Sustainability is closely intertwined with ecology and environmental protection. As a front runner in BMW s global production network, the BMW Brilliance Shen - yang plant has pioneered the concept of sponge plant and naturebased solutions during the planning and implementation of the new project, actively adopted soil and water conservation measures, and selected a landscape design with more functions to protect the biodiversity of the plant. ongoing improvements to enhance water efficiency in vehicle production.

The new Plant Lydia, which commenced production officially in May 2022, reflects our green ambitions in this firstofitskind, stateoftheart auto manufacturing facility. POWERED BY LOWCARBON ENERGY We are receptive to emerging clean energy technologies and actively adopt what we deem beneficial to our goals. In 2021, our first Combined Heating and Power (CHP) in Liaoning has already began operation at Plant Lydia. This system enables energy transformation from coal to natural gas, which is expected to reduce CO emissions by 50 through energy replacement. The CHP will pro - vide supplies of electricity, heating and serve as a con - venient transfer method from natural gas to biogas. In the future, the CHP could provide electricity and heating via a dedicated pipeline. Other measures include opti - mising the use of solar energy through solar photovoltaic RESOURCE UTILISATION IMPROVEMENT Comprehensive water efficiency measurements were taken at Plant Lydia. Consequently, a total water con - sumption target has been set to measure the progress and outcome of our resourcesaving actions. We have enhanced water recycling as well through a number of measures, including building a rainwater collection sys - panels already installed in all parking lots at Plant Lydia. More panel installations are planned in both the produc - tion facilities and reserve area as well. The estimated capacity of solar photovoltaics is currently 23 MW, and we are actively exploring the potential to expand this share of onsite renewable electricity generation. Furthermore, we seek to explore innovative ways to improve energy efficiency. An electricity consumption target has already been set for Plant Lydia, which has also become a requirement for our equipment suppliers. We have also adopted the Building Information Modeling (BIM) system to improve energy efficiency by monitoring and adjusting the temperature and light changes in the office areas. In addition, we have adopted the pilot use of an Eoven, which is powered by renewable electricity to reduce CO 2 emissions by replacing natural gas usage.

In terms of carbon footprint and re - newable energy, the standards of National Green Plant and ISO 50001 will be extended to cover Plant Lydia. To further our share of onsite renewable energy, tar - gets for solar photovoltaics capacity have been detailed on our 2022 agenda. In addition, we will continue to explore the possibility of energy replacement, with heat pumps and biogas, for instance. In the future, cooper - ation with research institutions will be strengthened to better leverage digital technologies for CO reduction. Especially at our new plants, more definitive sustaina - bility actions will be taken. To this end, the Plant Da - dong Extension Projects will carry out phase III water reclamation capacity expansion, which will save nearly 130, 000 m of water per year upon commencement. As for Plant Lydia, NEV will be used for inner plant logis - tics. And at both Plant Lydia and Plant Dadong, anew paint material with lower VOCs and higher solid content will be applied. From 2024 to 2025, Plant Lydia will be connected with the local metro line, which will lower down carbon emis - sions from employee commuting. PROMOTING CIRCULARITY In terms of our furniture selection, our principle for Plant Lydia is to reuse secondary office furniture from other plants as much as possible. As for the produc - tion process, we have built the capacity to separate iron and aluminium from mixed metal waste to provide better circulation. ECOLOGICAL CONSERVATION An ecological conservation garden will be built at Plant Lydia near the southwest assembly area for employ - ees to visit during lunch breaks and leisure time. Native species will be cultivated to preserve local biodiversity, anda small artificial lake will be included, supplied by rainwater or grey water. Water conservation measures will also be taken, including putting a clay layer in the soil to better hold water for healthy tree growth. tem for irrigation, collecting used water from production for secondary use such as car washing, and installing wastewater treatment facilities, all of which can save 40, 000 m 3 of water per year. We have also rolled out a series of measures at Plant Lydia to improve energy efficiency. In our Press Shop, we developed amain drive control cabinet on the second floor, which can reduce approximately 5 of power through improved energy efficiency and being totally free from the chiller water. In the Body Shop, the electri - cal welding gun and new control standard help contrib - ute to lowering energy consumption as well. In the Paint Shop, we focus on recirculation of building air between the processes through heat recapture and filtration. In addition, the ecoating reverse osmosis filtration system also allows for reduced fresh water consumption while lowering hazardous waste. Distributed solar panels installed at Plant Lydia.

In 2021, we initiated a pilot of an ETruck, which was the first heavy ETruck (20 t) used in Shenyang. The battery of the ETruck is powered by 100 renewable electricity, which could transport 56 White Car Bodies of the BMW iX 3 per day, and is estimated to reduce 2. 2 t of COper year and produce zero hazardous pollutants as compared to traditional fossil fuel. This programme is under evaluation and is set tobe rolled out for use in innerplant and interplant logistics in 2022. INBOUND LOGISTICS PRIORITISING LOWCARBON TRANSPORTATION MODES To introduce more lowcarbon transportation, BMW Brilliance is reducing CO emissions by scaling up lowcarbon and multimodal transportation. In 2021, we have made efforts to increase the share of transporta - tion modes with lower carbon emissions, such as railway and sea transportation. Shipments of cargo from Dali - an Port to our Shenyang plant are currently conducted through railway, with Plant Tiexi receiving 50 of their shipments and Plant Dadong receiving 90 of their shipments by train. Concurrently, we are continuing to grow the proportion of sea transportation at this moment we are only ferry - ing roughly 1 of inbound logistics through sea freight. Alongside our efforts to increase the share of rail and sea transportation that we utilise, we are also optimising our road transportation by maximising the payload mass to reduce transport frequency and integrating lowcar - bon criteria into our supplier selection process. Potential suppliers are encouraged to adopt lowcarbon transpor - tation modes and utilise the fulltruckload method. BUILDING RESILIENT LOGISTICS THROUGH RISK MANAGEMENT BMW Brilliance highly values stability in our inbound logistics, and as such we are proactively monitoring potential risks, including climaterelated risks, and providing preventive solutions to build resilient logistics. Frontdesk meetings are conducted to identify poten - tial risks and crossfunctional meetings are held every week to assess potential risks across the entire logistics IMPROVING LOGISTICS EFFICIENCY THROUGH DIGITAL PLANNING We are utilising digital planning to enhance the efficiency of shipment loading, which has resulted in a reduction of carbon emissions from our vehicles. The Plant Traffic Steering System (PTSS) has been utilised to moni - tor realtime intersection traffic.

Natural rainwater is collected through this system and is later utilised for car washing which not only conserves water expenditure but also independent utilities network and is thus more resilient against extreme weather conditions. Depending on varying weather conditions, roughly 80100 m 3 year of water can be saved, which is on average 1. 62 l car. As we have seen favourable results from this programme, we intend to extend it to other Finished Vehicles Dispatch Areas in future. Robert Kuessel Senior Vice President Technology and Manufacturing We are determined to lead from the forefront in lowcarbon logistics driven by technology and innovation.

For which we have developed the 2025 Aftersales Strategy, that sets sustainability as one of our cor - nerstones. We are constantly seeking solutions to promote green logistics and enhance performance in reducing our overall impact to the climate and environment. As part of our new strat - egy, we have set an ambitious carbon reduction target in 2026 to further reduce our carbon emissions by 1 3. GREEN TRANSPORTATION To forge a lowcarbon logistics system, we have reviewed our operations in its entirety and have made optimisations to our aftersales logistics with carbon efficiency as our primary focus. For international spare parts, we are work - ing to minimise airfreight replenishment as it generates a substantial amount of CO and gradually substitute it with railway transportation, the greener option. In 2021, 20 of our urgent airfreight replenishments were replaced by rail, thus reducing CO emissions by 10, 000 t. Our target is to replace 50 of urgent airfreight replenishments with greener transportation modes by 2026. Apart from more efficient and greener modes of trans - portation, we have optimised our inventory management system to adjust the usage of railway transportation based on market predictions, and we are seeking out local sourcing solutions for spare parts to avoid unnecessary international transportation. For domestic logistics, our aim is to lower our impact on the environment by increasing share of electric vehi - cles used. We have steadily deployed batterypowered ETrucks to deliver parts from Spare Parts Distribution Centre to our dealers. In 2021, two ETrucks were de - ployed in the Spare Parts Distribution Centre in Foshan, and one ETruck was deployed in the Spare Parts Distri - bution Centre in Hefei, both showing positive results. Our target is to reach 50 utilisation of ETrucks in Dealer Metro Distribution Centre (DMDC) delivery routes in 2026. Aside from taking direct and concrete actions, we be - lieve that thorough and complete data is the foundation for an effective measurement of our progress in achiev - ing our carbon reduction targets. We started to establish a digital carbon emission management system to trace the CO from aftersales logistics. Our interim target is to establish a CO 2 baseline condition and identify prelimi - nary decarbonisation approaches for aftersales logistics.

54 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE INTRODUCTION PRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION GREEN WAREHOUSE MANAGEMENT At BMW Brilliance, logistics performance is measured with sustainability factors, and in terms of warehouse management, the green warehouse is now our opera - tional standard. On the forefront of renewable electric - ity adoption, we were able to realise 100 renewable electricity for our six Spare Parts Distribution Centres across China in 2021 through IRECs. In particular, our Spare Parts Distribution Centre in Hefei has become the first green warehouse to be certified by Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Build - ing Standard, which is the most widely used and well recognised green building rating system in the world. Leading Warehouse Project Optimise aftersales logistics planning strategy Initiative To enhance our logistics planning process, we have implemented the Leading Warehouse Pro - ject. Through maintaining a certain stock of new or slowmoving parts at the Spare Parts Distribution Centre in Shanghai, we could avoid urgent internation - al airfreight and thus contribute to carbon reduction. BMW Brilliance's LEEDcertified Spare Parts Distribution Centre in Hefei. As we move forward, sustainability will become a new norm, as all the new Spare Parts Distribution Centres shall receive the LEED certification. In addition, all the new Spare Parts Distribution Centres will take part in the BMW Green Power Alliance project to adopt 100 renewable electricity with priority on power. Sustaina - bility is now a KPI that we take into consideration during our warehouse supplier selection process. One detail we would like to see from our suppliers is for at least 50 of the packaging used tobe returnable. As part of our push to make our warehouses greener, BMW Brilliance is planning to limit and reduce paper consumption. This is tobe accomplished through adjust -ing logistics operations and transitioning to alternative packaging materials for products. One example is to employ returnable packaging for Spare Parts Distribution Centre to dealer deliveries. We will also utilise electronic devices for business operations, such as using scanners during stocktakes to completely replace paper records. At the dealership level, we have implemented erecep - tion, eworkshops, and epayments to minimise paper use in our service process. 2022 FORECAST Looking to the new year, we will continue improving our green operations on all sectors of our logistics flow. For inbound logistics, we are conducting further LNG Truck pilots to resolve its challenges and optimise its functions. As LNG is more carbonefficient, we hope to increase its scope in the future. ETrucks will be rolled out for innerplant and interplant transportations. Our finished vehicle logistics work will focus on explor - ing the possibility of using the Sino Europe railway to export products such as the BMW iX 3. We are also planning to add Tianjin Port as an export port in 2022 to meet the needs of the growing business. This will not only reduce the number of ship changes contributing to CO reduction, but also maximise resource utilisation by integrating with imported vehicle transportation routes and improving efficiency. Finally, in terms of aftersales logistics, we will continu - ously promote our green logistic initiatives while explor - ing new possibilities of other clean energy solutions for transportation, including LNG and hydrogen.

56 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE INTRODUCTION PRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION ADOPTING RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN Renewable electricity is a crucial point of focus for BMW Brilliance to mobilise and encourage suppliers to make use of carbonfree power sources. To this end, we have conducted electricity mapping at our suppliers together with training to help them with renewable electricity pur - chases, and share our knowhow and lessons learned from our journey of transitioning to 100 renewable electricity in production. Our HVB Tier 1 supplier, CATL, from whom we purchased HVBs of 4. 14 GWh in 2021, achieved 100 renewable electricity in 2021. Our SUPPLY CHAIN CARBON REDUCTION In order to meet the BMW Group's ambitious 2030 goal of cutting supply chain CO emis - sions per vehicle produced by more than 20, as compared to 2019 level, while also meeting the Chinese government's dual carbon goals, BMW Brilliance has implemented a determined approach comprising a series of concrete ac - tions in the Supply Chain Match Plan China. MANAGEMENT APPROACH Sustainability has been comprehensively integrated into BMW Brilliance's supply chain management strat - egy. Through the use of rolemodelling and enabling, we are helping to drive a lowcarbon transition along the entire supply chain to achieve our ambitious com - mitments for carbon reduction. To this end, low carbon output has become a key criterion in our purchasing strategy, and we give priority to those suppliers who achieve lower carbon footprints. We regularly speak with our raw material suppliers about their carbonreduction strategies and goals to ensure that an appropriate and actionoriented syner - gy exists between BMW Brilliance and them. We also strongly encourage suppliers to accelerate the pace of their carbonreduction targets and roadmap towards greater sustainability. Moreover, we make it a point to connect our suppliers to the China Development Research Foundation (CDRF) platform where a great deal of useful carbonreduction information and other resources on government policies and industry peers actions can be found. SUPPLY CHAIN MATCH PLAN CHINA In 2021, the Supply Chain Match Plan China programme was a major milestone for BMW Brilliance to develop an integrated and customised plan for sustainable supply chain management across China. A dedicated team was also established for the Match Plan to develop a comprehensive management system in order to better coordinate a working synergy and cooperative mindset among different departments. Based on a thorough analysis of the carbon emissions across the entire supply chain, eight working packag - es were developed with specific individual targets set. These were not only targeted at raw materials and parts with high carbon emissions, such as steel, aluminium, High Voltage System (HVS), and plastics, but also incor - porated other key sustainability factors like renewable electricity, EHS, social responsibility, process manage - ment and government affairs in order to comprehensive - ly promote sustainable development for suppliers. Martin Schlicker Vice President Purchasing & QMP We are driving the green development across the value chain by fulfilling carbon reductions goals together with our suppliers. aluminium ingot suppliers, from whom we purchased a total of 20, 000 t aluminium ingot, also achieved 100 renewable electricity in 2021. Our carbon reduction philosophy also influences suppli - ers to actively consider sustainability issues during the construction and operation of their facilities. For exam - ple, greater numbers of suppliers are now considering the installation of solar photovoltaic panels during the site selection stage of their construction planning.

57 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE INTRODUCTION PRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION SUPPLIER ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH & SAFETY MANAGEMENT SUPPLIER EHS MANAGEMENT APPROACH The EPA is a thorough risk assessment process that identifies, analyses, and rectifies potential EHS risks throughout the supply chain from Tier 1 to NTier. It also covers 10 processes, including risk identification, policy trends, process optimisation, database informa - tion management, training, auditing, early warning, and fast response. Our approach provides all suppliers with corrective actions and continuous capacitybuilding activities. We also use a digital Environmental Risk Management System (ERMS), which enables us and our suppliers to respond more efficiently to potential EHS risks. For highrisk suppliers, onsite assessments are conducted via an independent third party. For lowrisk suppliers, we have a selfassessment checklist and a special Challenge Round. We also require additional evidence supporting our suppliers selfassessment results. OPTIMISATION OF EHS MANAGEMENT We have optimised our EPA programme by getting more suppliers involved while also enriching the contents of the digital management system. In 2021, the scope of the Challenge Round was expanded. Previously, it was for internal staff members, but this year we have includ - ed Tier 1 suppliers who are responsible for NTiers. BMW Brilliance guided the process to help Tier 1 suppli - ers become responsible for their own supply chain per - formance results. For the ERMS, we have added a news module, which publishes EHSrelevant news to suppli - ers. It is also equipped with an external risk eventtrack - ing module to provide suppliers with a rapid feedback function for external events, placing greater focus on suppliers EHS risks within the manufacturing sector. SUPPLIER EHS MANAGEMENT ACHIEVEMENTS In 2021, we audited 51 companies from our supply chain, comprising 20 nominated suppliers and 31 NTier suppli - ers. The initial audit result for 2021 was 14 red 8 yellow 29 green. By the end of 2021, we successfully improved the average audit score from an initial 88 to 95. We also finished 107 Challenge Rounds for those suppli - ers responsible for NTiers, initially resulting in 4 red 2 yellow 101 green. In addition, several risk management activities were carried out on environmental and social matters, including risk management for heavy pollution output during winter weather. We designed a contingen - cy plan forB C D rated suppliers in Liaoning and helped them improve over the long term. We also drew up risk management contingency plans for possible production restrictions due to the Olympic Winter Games. We have pioneered a concrete and holistic supplier EHS risk management system through our Environment, Health and Safety Protection Activity (EPA) programme that has set a bench - mark for EHS within our industry.

Since 2020, we have had in place the BMW Brilliance Supplier Social Responsibility Code of Conduct while continuing to promote and integrate social re - sponsibility measures across our entire supply chain. In 2021, we made key progress in our Supply Chain Social Responsibility Initiatives. In 2021, we enhanced our supplier social responsibili - ty management, which included publishing a supplier checklist and engaging four suppliers in pilot schemes. Moreover, we completed four internal training sessions and designed a video training course for suppliers, which went live with training sessions in December 2021. ETHICAL AND TRANSPARENT SOURCING OF HVB RAW MATERIALS Materialspecific sourcing strategies were initiated by BMW Brilliance to guarantee maximum transparency while fostering responsible business practices across our entire supply chain. Two critical raw materials con - tained in HVBs cobalt and lithium help power our NEV fleet. We recognised the importance of responsi - ble procurement of raw materials when sourcing from regions experiencing political and social conflicts, which 2022 FORECAST Looking ahead in 2022, as the development of our Supply Chain Match Plan China progresses, addi - tional specific indicators and targets will beset to better measure and manage our performance. In addition, we are exploring the application of other renewable electricity solutions. In terms of supplier EHS management, we have combined the EHS scheme and social responsibility programme, allowing us to integrate internal stand - ards into the entire supply chain. As a result, we will provide social responsibility training to suppliers while conducting ongoing EPA audits. may include minerals such as cobalt and lithium from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Since 2020, we have begun sourcing cobalt for the Gen 5 HVB cells directly from mines outside of the DRC, in Australia and Morocco, and made it available to our HVB manufactur - er. By providing full knowledge and transparency about the origins of cobalt, we are able to minimise the risk of child labour and human rights violations from the sourc - ing of this material.

To this end, we publish Partner Satisfaction Index on regular basis to various internal customers and shareholders on selected real estate management topics of major importance. In 2021, we received positive feedback about office wasteman - agement, and we subsequently initiated awaste audit project to further examine this issue more closely. Moreover, an employee survey was also conducted on the office waste management topic to gain a better un - derstanding of employees overall awareness, aswell as to consider the optimal way to implement their sugges - tions on a scheme for waste classification at the office. As a result, based on the analysis of our current perfor - mance, we collectively came up with several creative proposals on how to improve office waste management. The next step will involve taking further action to facili - tate better office waste management through enhancing our waste classification system and increasing employee awareness on this matter. INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY INTO REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION PROCESS BMW Brilliance ceaselessly works to integrate more sus - tainable factors into its selection criteria for nonproduc - tion sites, which forges solid, sustainable foundations for greener operations. This is evident in our selection of office buildings and other key facilities. To this end, we will give a stronger focus on sustainability when choos - ing proprietors, especially those holding sustainable building certifications or being equipped with renewable electricity supply. In addition, environmental impact as - sessments will be carried out to improve each building's overall sustainability performance. Sustainability will also be an essential factor for new facilities when we are evaluating partnerships with potential qualified suppliers and contractors. TRANSFORMING INTO GREENER BUILDINGS BMW Brilliance strives to create a working environment that is both healthy for our personnel and friendly to the planet. In 2021, we benchmarked with the world's lead - ing green building standards LEED and WELL. We are singularly determined to identify those elements that will effectively transform our working environment to benefit our employees health while also contributing positively to the environment. Based on our gap analysis, we plan to make improvements by upgrading our air filtration systems to improve indoor air quality. Moreover, we will proactively carry out air and water quality testing, and install direct drinking water facilities across office area to ensure optimum water quality. We also plan to embark on a companywide training and communication pro - gramme to keep employees abreast of the latest neces - sary environmental measures. Furthermore, we have also leveraged digital solutions to strengthen our environmental management. In our future efforts to optimise the management of the 25 nonproduc - tion sites across China, including the new ones under con - sutruction, we will actively seek to digitalise our workre - lated tasks to become greener and more sustainable. To aid in this task, we are developing a unified environmental management platform and will go live in April 2022 to collect data at all nonproduction sites regarding water and energy consumption, air quality indexes, and waste statistics. This platform can effectively integrate a variety of functions, including data maintenance, performance reporting, regulation tracking, training, aswell as audit support, to help improve overall facility management. It also enables realtime facility management data monitor - ing, to provide reference for further improvements. 2022 FORECAST We are currently developing our own sustainable building standards for all nonproduction sites, incorporating key sustainability aspects from site selection, through building design to construction, and until facility management. Our digitised facility management approach is enabling us to measure and monitor more indicators, which will help us set clear environmental targets in the near future and develop concrete reduction actions. Digitalised management of building operation and environmental performance. In terms of overall energy consumption, BMW Brilliance ensures 100 renewable electricity through IRECs at its 25 nonproduction sites, including 9 offices, 2 research and development centres, 6 spare parts distribution cen - tres, 5 training centres, 1 consolidation centre, and 2 brand experience centres.

Our Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management System was developed based on several policies or standards, including the BMW Group H&S policy, UNGC, the ISO 45001 2018 stand - ard, ILO s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, aswell as all applicable regulations in China. In 2021, we updated the OHS Management Li - ability Letter according to the Work Safety Law (2021 Amendment), with employees signed on. OHS TRAINING AND COMMUNICATION Along with a comprehensive OHS management sys - tem, we are also working on employee safety skills and awareness enhancement through OHS training. In addition to the Threelevel Safety Training for new employees, we also provide safety training for employees on specific topics such as LOTO (Lock - out Tagout), chemicals, work in confined spaces, PPE (Personal Protective Equipment), and Hot Work. OHS HAZARDS AND RISK MANAGEMENT To better manage OHS hazards and risks, BMW Bril - liance has designed and posted a safety risk distribution map based on hazard identification, risk assessment and risk control planning. Safety risk bulletin boards and safety risk notification cards are posted in the workshop throughout key areas of the premises respectively. We launched the project Today for Tomorrow NEXT with the pilot in the Plant Tiexi Assembly Shop in the fourth quarter of 2020, and successfully completed in June 2021. Since then, we have proceeded with logistics at Plant Dadong. Our project focuses on ergonomic con - ditions, behavioural patterns aswell as job rotations. In this way, we can prevent employees from musculoskel - etal disorders. From results gleaned from our evalua -tion of the Safety and Ergonomics Risk Assessment (SERA) aswell as onsite ergonomic behaviour obser - vations of 454 workplaces at Plant Tiexi and 192 work - places in logistics at Plant Dadong, our health depart - ment developed a series of exercises tailored for each workplace. These are designed so that associates can use their off time to do specific exercises which can re - lieve physical stress caused by their working postures. In addition, several optimised working postures were also taught to operators to mitigate possible health hazards. 2, 310 employees attended the training sessions to learn about ergonomic behaviour and exercises designed to ensure their wellbeing.

FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESOTHER INFORMATIONPRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORKOTHER INFORMATION 90 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE INTRODUCTION EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETY COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE As an integral part of an effective compliance management system, the robust organisation - al framework BMW Brilliance has ensured that a proper compliance accountability structure is put in place. The Board of Directors (BoD) of BMW Brilliance assumes the ultimate respon - sibility for administering the compliance management system at the shareholder level. The Audit and Compliance Committee (AC) under the BoD sets compliance objectives, allocates resources and monitors practices to ensure complete compliance with all regulatory and ethical requirements. Authorised by the BoD, BMW Brilliance's Board of Management and Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee, serving as its subcommittee, takes the primary oversight role. To cope with today'sever changing regulatory environment and business needs, the committee continues to expand its scope of responsibility to include a greater focus on antimoney laun - dering measures, export controls, product monitoring, and internal control systems of retail, starting from 2021. A dedicated department of Corporate Governance and Compliance was established to manage overall compliance programmes. Its department head then reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer of the company. Moreover, the broader compliance steering depart - ments also collaborate to enable business departments to implement compliance pro - grammes in their daily operations, and to help mitigate compliance risks more effectively. As the Compliance Responsible of each department, the department heads have the duty to make sure they and their teams act in full compliance. Moreover, the role of Compliance Interface, which serves as a bridge between business operations and the central compliance function, was created and nominated by all departments. Customised education and com - munication channels are provided across the broader compliance network, and consultant services are always available to support their daily operations. COMPLIANCE TRAINING In 2021, 22 oneonone sessions were arranged with the newly onboard Compliance Re - sponsible and Compliance Interface. Two workshops were held to reinforce compliance requirements while facilitating the discussion over a host of challenges and hot topics, and the best practices were shared among the participants. Around 120 Compliance Interface managers attended various events.

FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESOTHER INFORMATIONPRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORKOTHER INFORMATION 91 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE INTRODUCTION EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS BMW Brilliance attaches great importance to its leadership role in society, making social responsibility a major focus of our production. We strive to minimise our impact on the envi - ronment in all of our manufacturing processes. In 2021, all our production plants successfully passed the ISO 14001 2015 Environmental Management System certificate renewal audit. In order to better meet the stringent environmental protection requirements that our diverse stakeholders established, we have proactively updated and optimised many environmental procedures that are now already in effect. ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND STEERING BMW Brilliance has established the Green Plant Circle and held regular meetings to discuss sustainability topics. We are committed to exploring additional enablers as well as opportu - nities to help us improve overall green performance and reduce our impact on the environ - ment, including energysaving measures and zero waste policies. RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT To avoid foreseeable risks and integrate ecofriendly concepts as early as possible, we have an environmental management department that goes into action during the project design phase to analyse and assess all possible environmental impacts. During the construction phase, we monitor environmental risks and ensure compliance with the project team. For smallscale project modifications, the project team consults with the environmental manage - ment team to evaluate any possible environmental impacts and recommends ecofriendly thinking in the early production stages by completing a change management checklist. The environmental management team also works in tandem with the compliance team to stay up to date on all regulatory changes. A total of 46 items were identified as a result of en - vironmental laws and regulations updates, and the evaluation results were published on the company's Legislation Express. We are confident in mapping out strategies to fulfil the latest stakeholder requirements and expectations. BMW Brilliance takes great pride in placing environmental concerns at the core of its en - tire operations. We work hard every day to minimise any negative impacts that could occur during the automotive production process. In 2021, we continued to take a series of effective measures to reduce pollutants and wastes while also enhancing our natural resource utilisa - tion management. VOC EMISSIONS REDUCTION In 2021, our Plant Tiexi and Plant Dadong Extension Projects completed the installation of stateoftheart volatile organic compounds (VOC) treatment facilities, which will make a significant contribution towards VOC emissions reduction. By the end of 2021, we cut perve - hicle VOC emissions by 76 from 0. 50 to 0. 12 kg per vehicle. From 2022, Plant Lydia and Plant Dadong will begin the use of BC 1, which is anew type of paint ingredient containing 66 fewer VOCs and higher solid content. We will also continue to expand the use of wa - terbased solvents, and focus on exploring ways to lower VOC materials. COMPREHENSIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT Today we have greater capabilities than ever before to reduce and sustainably manage the waste generated by our operations. This has been made possible through upgrades in our wasteflow tracking and overall improvements in the traceability of hazardous pollutants. In 2021, anew BMW Brilliance ITpioneered weighing system was unveiled. This new system is much more reliable and will help significantly improve our onsite waste management efforts by enhancing the traceability requirement process. We have also optimised waste recycling methods at our production plants. For example, since January 2021, nearly 150 t year of wet iron sludge waste was sent for incineration, gen - erating 375, 000 k Wh. Furthermore, around 20 t year of dry iron sludge waste was diverted from landfill and recycled to produce 20 t year of auxiliary raw materials. At Plant Dadong, our sludge dehydration programme was initiated in 2021, which significantly decreased the water content of sludge by 40, eventually lowering overall sludge generation by nearly one kg per vehicle produced. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT RESOURCE CONSUMPTION AND EFFICIENCY MEASURES
FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESOTHER INFORMATIONPRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORKOTHER INFORMATION 92 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE INTRODUCTION EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETY Adhering to our 4 R principle (Reduction, Reuse, Recycling, Regeneration), BMW Brilliance actively seeks cooperation with our suppliers to enact compliant waste disposal measures and explore other ways to reduce resource waste. To this end, all of our potential waste han - dling suppliers must undergo an extensive evaluation process in order tobe qualified and se - lected. For existing suppliers, we audit their documentation and continuously perform onsite inspections to ensure valid and proper disposal of all waste. In 2021, as a result of changes in waste classifications and improvements in various treatment processes, the wastepervehi - cle we sent off for disposal decreased from 2. 99 to 2. 50 kg per vehicle produced. WATER AND WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT We use reclaimed water generated from a wastewater treatment station for irrigation and cooling purposes. Moreover, the Paint Shop at Plant Dadong Extension Projects has gradually expanded its water reclamation facility capacity since June 2021, resulting in a watersaving of 80, 000 m 3. The capacity expansion work at Phase III also continues apace. The Paint Shop at Plant Tiexi has introduced new oily wastewater reduction technology to separate the oil component from the wastewater. This has resulted in the concentration volume of oily waste - water decreasing by 71, allowing us to save nearly 10 t month in water usage. Furthermore, BMW Brilliance is continually exploring new resources for use at Plant Lydia, including rainwa - ter collection aswell as a reuse project that will begin construction in 2022. BMW Brilliance has also initiated a host of strict routine waterconserving measures, in - cluding the use of waterefficient fixtures and posting watersaving signage throughout the production and office areas. To better monitor and control water consumption, one of our tasks in 2022 is to esablish additional process water target for our proudction, and we have already initiated the targetsetting process this year. We also regularly introduce improve - ments towards reducing the water intensity for vehicle production. In 2021, we achieved 1. 82 m 3 of water used per vehicle, an improvement compared to 1. 97 m 3 in 2020. SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION AND BIODIVERSITY In our ongoing efforts to integrate ecological protection into our production environment, BMW Brilliance's Shenyang production facilities have adapted sponge plants and na - turebased solution concepts to revive the overall environment in our plants. Moreover, we have introduced grass planting bricks, clay water retainer layers and other ecological measures to ensure better soil and water conservation. We have designed 1. 65 million m 2 of landscaping area in our new plants, comprising over 11, 000 tree stems, and the landscaping corridors and biodiversity area are currently under construction. We also make use of spoil backfill and soil thatch to recycle 2. 73 million m 2 of earthwork. In addition, more than 30 plant species will be introduced into our production facility via layered landscaping. This will not only contribute to greater biodiversity, but also create a more harmonious work environment for our employees and our neighbours. BMW Brilliance's senior leadership takes overall responsibility and accountability for prevent - ing workrelated injuries and ensuring safe and healthy workplaces for all employees. Our leadership team has developed OHS policies and objects to align with our strategic goals and ensures the effective operation and continual improvement of the system. The CEO ap - points the Head of Security, Occupational Safety and Services Department, as the Occupa - tional Health and Safety Management Representative to organise and further the operation of the OHS management system and advance a culture of safety throughout the company. The Designated OHS Management Coordinator, a senior manager from the Safety Manage - ment Department, serves as the secondincommand of this operation, supporting the OHS Management Representative in sustaining this important safety work.

Emissions from the upstream chain and disposal processes are based on the carbon footprint of representative vehicles from the BMW Group's product lines, calculated by Thinkstep s LCA tool Ga Bi which took into account Chinese market factors in the calculation. 2. The increase in this figure is mainly due to the reporting scope expansion. Leveraged on improved data traceability, we managed to track and report CO 2 emissions from international inbound logistics (USChina route) in 2021. 3. The fleet emissions are extrapolated from the average fleet emissions of automobiles produced by BMW Brilliance for sales in mainland China market of the year. The calculation was based on an average mileage of 150, 000 km. 4. The increase in business trip and the employees commuting in 2021 was mainly due to the recovery of business operation and employees commuting from COVID 19 s impact, as compared to 2020. 5. In addition to BMW Brilliance's Shenyang production base, as of 2021, BMW Brilliance ensured 100 renewable electricity use at its nonproduction sites. 6. The yearonyear reduction of volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions was mainly due to the utilisation of new VOC treatment facilities and the optimisation of our paint shops operation.

CRITERIA The criteria used by the Company to prepare the selected key data in the 2021 Sustainability Report is set out in the definitions of the key data in Chapter 5. 5 of the 2021 Sustainability Report (the basis of reporting ). THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT S RESPONSIBILITIES The Board of Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the selected key data in the 2021 Sustainability Report inaccordance with the basis of reporting. This responsibility includes de - signing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation of the selected key data in the 2021 Sustainability Report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. OUR INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehen - sive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. PRACTITIONER S RESPONSIBILITIES It is our responsibility to express a conclusion on the selected key data in the 2021 Sustainability Re - port based on our work. We conducted our work inaccordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Infor - mation. This standard requires that we plan and perform our work to form the conclusion. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the Company's 2021 selected key data in the 2021 Sustainability Report has been prepared, in all material respects, inaccordance with the basis of reporting. Our work involves assessing the risks of material misstatement of the selected key data in the 2021 Sustainability Report whether due to fraud or error, and responding to the assessed risks. The extent of procedures selected depends on our judgment and assessment of the engage - ment risk. Within the scope of our work, we have performed the following procedures in Beijing Office, Tiexi Plant, Dadong Plant and Powertrain Plant of the Company 1. Interviews with relevant departments of the Company involved in providing information for the selected key data within the Sustainability Report; and 2. Analytical procedures; 3. Examination, ona test basis, of documentary evidence relating to the selected key data on which we report; 4. Recalculation; and 5. Other procedures deemed necessary. 2022 SH 0226 (PAGE 2 OF 3)

CONCLUSION Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 2021 selected key data in the 2021 Sustainability Report is not prepared, in all material respects, inaccordance with the basis of reporting. RESTRICTION ON USE Our report has been prepared for and only for the board of management of the Company and for no other purpose.
