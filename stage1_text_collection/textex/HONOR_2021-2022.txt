As China commits to achieving the 3060 carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals and other governments worldwide set carbon neutrality targets, policies and laws related to green development have been introduced in various regions. These measures place increasingly stringent requirements on the green transition of enterprises across the entire industry chain, including energy conservation, emission reduction, and restrictions on the use of plastics, which may lead to increased production and operational costs. Regulators have issued increasingly comprehensive strict and demanding guidelines on climate changerelated disclosure. Enterprises must improve their management of carbon emissions data and disclosure capabilities, possibly leading to increased operational costs. Enterprises need to promote the development of new clean energy technologies, optimize product design, and create green products that combine user experience with environmental benefits to seize a firstmover advantage in the market. However, the transition to new technologies may increase the investment on R&D. With the increasing attention from all sectors of society to environmental protection, consumers will prefer lowcarbon and environmentally friendly electronic products. Enterprises that can meet consumers' demand for environmentally friendly products will be able to seize the market more quickly. Integrate carbon reduction targets into our corporate strategy and strive to achieve emission peak by 2030.

According to the China Disabled Persons Federation and other data providers, approximately 17 million people have low vision and over 27 million are hearing impaired in China. National economic data released by the National Bureau of Statistics in early 2022 shows that China's elderly population over 60 years old exceeds 267 million, accounting for 18. 9 of the country's population. Restricted by the physical environment and their own conditions at different levels, people with disabilities experience obstacles and difficulties in accessing, utilizing, and leveraging information. HONOR upholds the concept of technology for good and is committed to enabling equal access for everyone to share the benefits of technological development and enjoying the convenience brought by digital life. In order to bridge the digital divide for people with disabilities, we have setup a working group on accessibility to analyze the problems they face in using mobile phones, listen to their opinions, explore user needs and application scenarios. We also continue our efforts to advance technological innovation to deliver an ultra user experience. In this digital world, visually impaired users will find it incredibly difficult touse electronic products and will be unable to keep upwith the rapidly evolving information environment without appropriate voice assistive technologies. Limited by visual impairment, complicated operations and mass data will only trap visually impaired users in an information silo and become a barrier to accessing what they want.

Information accessibility aims to make information equally and conveniently accessible and usable for everyone in every scenario. In the digital era, information accessibility not only benefits individuals with disabilities, but is also closely related to every person's life. Healthy people can also face barriers to accessing information in certain scenarios, such as receiving a phone call when their hands are greasy in the kitchen, being unable to move due to a sports injury, or being unable to answer a phone call in the middle of a meeting with their boss. To break down the barriers to device usage, we have developed several functional modules, including AI Lens, AI Voice, and AI Services. Such a comprehensive system connects people, devices, and services with AI technology and presents common features for users in a simple way. Based on the principle of IDEAL, HONOR has worked hard on addressing such bothering issues with technology. 61 AI Lens can quickly recognize all kinds of text information in the digital and physical world. The monthly users of the Magic Text service have reached 14. 9 million. AI Voice provides a more convenient voice interaction service to over 50 of HONOR users in various scenarios, such as taking pictures and answering calls. Voice Assistant YOYO is activated over 340 million times each month to provide smart services, a yearonyear increase of 78. 9. HONOR hopes to improve the exposure of thirdparty apps to target users through MagicOS, thus promoting their business. By the end of 2023, MagicOS had been used by 927 thirdparty partners through YOYO Suggestions, improving efficiency for millions of users every month. AI empowers extensive accessibility Develop universal products and services for all users by adapting AI to all scenarios and collecting user insights to bridge the digital divide.
