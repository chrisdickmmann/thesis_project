4 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION Mr. Jochen Goller President and CEO BMW Group China Voice from ManagementTHOUGHT LEADERSHIP ON CHINA S SUSTAINABILITY JOURNEY The year 2022 was full of economic and social challenges, amongst them postpandemic pressure on the economy, rising inflation aswell as the more and more visible impact of climate change. However, especially in times of uncertainty and volatility, decisive and measurable actions are essential. Inspired by both, the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 20 th National Congress's Vision of Highquality Development, the BMW Group China is fully committed to taking a leading role in the transformation of our industry. We aim to deeply embed sustainability into all aspects of the automotive value chain. And our continuing China sustainability journey is not anew one, in fact we have started already 20 years ago. Based on an optimistic, longterm perspective on China, we will further expand our local investment and footprint and reinforce our strong commitment towards this country, and we will of course do this in a sustainable way. BMW Group was the first German automotive manufacturer to join the Science Based Targets Initiative Business Ambition for 1. 5 C, as a result we will make sure every step to sustainability is scientifically validated and transparent also here in China. OUR FUTURE IS ELECTRIC, DIGITAL AND CIRCULAR Succeeding in shaping the future of mobility requires a bold vision which for us is Electric, Digital and Circular. Electric drivetrains are one essential prerequisite for climateneutral mobility. We are right now rapidly expanding our range of electric vehicles across all BMW Group brands. As of today, we offer five fully electric models in China and have established a complete Emobility ecosystem from supply chain and production to sales and customer service. Looking forward, BMW Group aims to increase its annual global share of electric vehicles sales to 50 at the latest by 2030. Digital transformation across our whole company is essential to further increase the efficiency of our supply and production system, to personalise customer experiences and to emotionalise our products. In this context, the BMW i Vision Dee is showcasing how the future interaction and communication between human and vehicle could look like. Circular is another cornerstone of our vision to create the ecofriendly electric car based on re think, recycle, reuse, and re duce that guides us to extract valuable raw materials for the cars of tomorrow from the cars of today. We aim to significantly increase the use of secondary materials and have made quite some progress in China this year by setting up a closedloopcircle for highvoltage batteries. ONLY THROUGH TRANSPARENCY CAN ACTIONS BE MEASURED The first ever BMW Group China Sustainability Report, launched this year, is showcasing our comprehensive approach and concerted efforts on driving and managing sustainability across all our China entities. It is a testament to the strong commitments of our around 28, 000 associates. 2023 will witness a growing range of sustainability and CSR projects being implemented by BMW Group China and we are inviting all our Chinese partners and stakeholders to join as we are accelerating towards the future of Electric, Digital and Circular mobility.
Dr. Franz Decker President and CEO BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. 5 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION ROOTED IN CHINA COMMITTED TO ACTION In what seems like the blink of an eye but is now 20 years BMW Brilliance has rooted itself in China. Over the course of those two decades, we have grown to become the largest manufacturing facility within the BMW Group worldwide, with an annual production capacity of 830, 000 units. We have nurtured an expansive network of local suppliers and dealers who thrive alongside us, joining hands to form a worldclass industry chain that spans China. We take tremendous pride inbeing an integral part of Liaoning s great industrial spirit, and sharing an extraordinary growth journey with the city of Shenyang our home in China. At the heart of our 20 years of success is a longheld and unwavering commitment to sustainable development a responsibility that has deepened and grown over time. As our society embarks on the sustainable transformation pathways outlined in China's 14 th Five Year Plan, BMW Brilliance is poised to lead the green development of the country's automotive industry. To that end, we have prioritised our sustainability efforts in three distinct areas low carbon emissions, circularity and social contributions. We are delighted to share our progress in this report. DECARBONISING THE VALUE CHAIN BMW Brilliance leads climate action and largescale transformation throughout our value chain. In 2022, the Supply Chain Project China was expanded to reduce our carbon impact. A lowcarbon steel supply chain was established, while more than 40 of our local suppliers and 100 of our aluminium ingot suppliers switched already to renewable electricity. Meanwhile, to reduce energy consumption and CO 2 emissions from our operations, we tailored BMW s iFACTORY strategy for China. We achieved 100 renewable electricity 1 atour Shenyang manufacturing base in 2019, and at 37 nonmanufacturing sites this year. And we have launched the Network Transformation Green Star Project an industry first to empower dealers to provide green services. Fifty dealers have so far been certified. Logistics plays avital role in driving green transformation across our value chain. We have reduced our carbon footprint through initiatives such as rail freight transportation, the use of ETrucks and green warehouse management. Our pioneering efforts in sustainability are widely recognised by the government and market. BMW Brilliance has topped the China Automotive Industry Green Development Index for four years. 1. Both externally sourced and internally generated electricity is renewable. Voice from Management
6 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION CIRCULARITY TO CLOSE THE LOOP Only by recycling and reusing materials can we ensure a sustainable future. In China, we adhere to BMW s philosophies of Secondary First and RETHINK, REDUCE, REUSE, RECYCLE. In 2022, we created a closedloop for raw materials used in highvoltage batteries (HVBs) by facilitating the recycling of nickel, lithium and cobalt. We are making progress on secondary materials recycling and reuse for steel, aluminium, platinum group metals and plastics. Our ongoing efforts to scale up secondary use for retired HVBs and to expand the categories of parts for remanufacturing are bearing good results. Enhancing circularity also entails conserving resources and minimising waste. In 2022, by upgrading our facilities, we saved more than 150, 000 m 3 of water and prevented at least 1, 000 t of waste. We were pleased to be recognised as one of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's first National Industrial Wastewater Recycling Pilot Enterprises, and our annual water consumption per vehicle produced declined for a fifth year. NURTURING OUR PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNITY The quality of an organisation should not just be measured by its economic success but also the social contributions. A good company has to take care of conditions for employees, workers in the value chain and local communities. Over the years, we have created more than 25, 800 highquality jobs in China. And we cultivate local content suppliers and distributors on our sustainability journey. In 2022, our local content suppliers numbered 429, with a total purchasing volume of RMB 73. 47 billion. Committed to our community, we use innovative and collaborative approaches to direct our corporate social responsibility efforts to China's most urgent social needs. We support rural revitalisation, biodiversity and cultural protection. In 2022, we achieved a historic high of nearly 31. 9 million beneficiaries for our corporate social responsibility activities. And we donated RMB 2 million to earthquake relief in Luding County, demonstrating our commitment to providing robust assistance in crises. Rooted in China, BMW Brilliance has risen from humble origins to achieve fruitful results for two decades. As we go full power on electric, digital and circular, we are committed to delivering another 20 years of success for BMW while contributing to China's ongoing, high quality development. To usher in a more splendid chapter, we will continue to protect the environment and the climate, add value to our products, and ensure prosperity for both stakeholders and the wider community. Genuine sustainable leadership spearheads the complete lowcarbon and circular transformation of the entire value chain. We are propelling green innovation and practices by working with industry partners. Together, we are not merely shaping a brighter future, but also inspiring others to follow suit.

7 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION Supply chain sustainability is the management of environmental, social and economic impacts, and the encouragement of positive practices, throughout the lifecycles of products and services. As one of the largest OEMs in China, we can leverage the influence to engage with more suppliers about respect of lowcarbon, circular and social responsibility, and thereby to advance real changes throughout our value chain. By undertaking initiatives to encourage development and diffusion of environmental and social friendly approaches, in 2021 we have launched the Supply Chain Project in China and established endtoend sustainability processes for Chinese suppliers, covering many aspects such as key raw materials, renewable energy, EHS, and social responsibility. In this way we are actively engaged with suppliers, mainstreaming values and actions down to raw material producers, with empowerment and connection to platforms such as China Development Research Foundation, to maximise the overall social, environmental and ethical impact. Mr. Thomas Schmid President, BMW China Services Ltd. Dr. Robert Kahlenberg Senior Vice President, BMW Research & Development China Circularity is a solution one of many needed to address climate change. Materials reuse, adapting supply chains, reshaping market perceptions will be challenging but key to ensuring an environmental and circular transition. Our design is the nascent stages, and the attempts enhance the effective of the implementation of sustainable manufacturing. Our target of increasing the proportion of secondary materials in the thermoplastics used in new vehicles from currently around 20 to an average of over 40 by 2030. To maximise the recyclability and recycled materials used in our vehicles, we investigate each component to reduce emission. For redesigning and refurbishing, from alloy wheels to seating, we ensure the performance, safety, stability, and consistency. For instance, on top of our new BMW X 1 recycled nylon practices that's synthesised from discarded fish net and worn floor covering, we also have around 150 kg of recycled aluminium had been used in the new BMW i 7. Mr. Robert Kuessel Senior Vice President, Technology and Manufacturing, BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.

INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION 18 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 The past year presented formidable challenges, as the effects of climate change wrought havoc on our ecosystems and depleted our resources. This environmental crisis creates obstacles to a global green economy resource and energy shortages, and risk of supply chain disruption. The automotive industry has a significant impact on the natural environment. Our sustainable transformation is therefore imperative for tackling global challenges of air pollution, global warming and resource conservation. Digitalisation and electrification are driving revolutionary change in our product development and production. These advances are paving the way fora circular economy, thereby mitigating the impact of our value chain on the environment. Therefore, 2022 compels united action and cooperation and, as a company deeply rooted in China, the BMW Group China stands as an emblem of collaboration and growth. The 20 th National Congress highlighted the need for green development and harmony between humanity and nature. This principle provides a clear roadmap for our carbon neutral targets. Consequently, 2022 saw increasingly steadfast commitment to sustainable development by BMW Group China. SUSTAINABILITY MEGATRENDS As we evolve, so the priorities of our valued stakeholders undergo transformation. We extend our sustainable development and disclosure throughout the BMW Group in China, remain committed to ongoing engagement with stakeholders through extensive dialogues, communication activities and platforms, and honing our stakeholder focus with rigorous evaluations. For us tobe At Home in China, we are maintaining close dialogue with local governments and being proactive to pursue winwin outcomes. In 2022, Dr. Franz Decker participated in the China Germany Sister City Forum with the theme Green and Digital New Impetus for China and Germany Sister Cities Mutual Beneficial Cooperation, and delivered a keynote speech in the green cooperation subforum. To drive lowcarbon transformation for our industry, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the HBIS Group in 2022 to establish a green and lowcarbon steel supply chain through collective efforts. We have also deepened our strategic partnership with Maple Leaf Car Rental, and the first batch of allnew BMW i 3 will now be deployed to Maple Leaf Car Rental's nationwide service network. By providing customers with personalised highquality travel experiences, we are leading the way in promoting lowcarbon travel in China.

INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION 19 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 Since our last materiality assessment in 2020, the world has undergone significant changes not only with COVID 19, but also the conflicts in Europe, the growing urgency to take climate actions and the rapidly changing regulatory requirements, and more. As a result, our stakeholders expectations of our performance have changed, so in 2022 we conducted a refreshed materiality assessment to identify and prioritise the sustainability issues that matter most to our business and key stakeholders. Our refreshed assessment is based on the double materiality assessment approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methods. Our final list of material issues was developed via analysis of megatrends and policies, while adhering to the double materiality principle proposed by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). This allowed us to consider financial and impact perspectives, for an allround understanding of the issues. The materiality matrix was based on 15 interviews and more than 350 questionnaires with eight internal and external stakeholder groups. The top management reviewed and confirmed the results to ensure their validity and relevance. The horizontal axis represents the significance of the environmental and social impact of the BMW Group China, and the vertical axis represents relevance to the BMW Group China's business success. MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT Our Materiality Assessment Process We began by listing 20 potential issues grouped into four categories Product Responsibility Environmental Social Governance Defining Issues We collected over 350 questionnaires from a representative crosssection of our eight stakeholder groups, followed by 15 indepth interviews with internal and external stakeholders. The result is a materiality matrix revealing the nine issues considered most relevant to BMW Group China as well as our stakeholders. Prioritising Issues We then grouped material issues into our strategic priorities. Our China Board has reviewed the results of our materiality analysis to validate the importance of each topic, and upon validation, we began crafting detailed action plans to deliver our commitment within each of the priority.

INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION 22 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 BMW Group China Climate Resilience Alliance Initiative To effectively address climate change, collaborative and coordinated actions are essential. For this reason, we have established the Climate Resilience Alliance within the company. It is a crossfunctional group led by the strategic department and includes representatives from key business segments such as supply chain, production, and sales. Through this mechanism, we have established effective communication and cooperation channels to identify the latest climate risks, conduct capacity building and crossfunctional collaboration to ensure that climate mitigation and adaptation measures are integrated into all business segments of the company. SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT The BMW Group China's commitment to sustainable development is putting into action by comprehensive, topdown management and collaboration. The BMW China Board is at the core of our leadership who guides us to integrate sustainability into all key business decisions that direct our company forward. Climate is changing faster than the world can keep up. Rising sea levels, more frequent droughts and severe storms are posing real threats not only to our SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE ENHANCING CLIMATE RISK ASSESSMENT AND RESILIENCESustainability is a central feature of our annual targetsetting process, through which business functions must set and deliver on concrete targets, which allows us to implement the guidance of the China Board in a systematic way, with accountability for the business functions. The China Board is also responsible for ensuring compliance with all provisions of the law and internal regulations, aswell as for adequate risk management and control. Our dedicated China Sustainability Circle steers development, provides regular updates and progress reports to the China Board, assigns tasks and seeks feedback. This ensures sustainability remains at the forefront of our business. Dedicated Sustainability Circles focus on our production and supply chain. Crossfunctional and divisional circles reinforce initiatives across the company. By enabling feedback from our operations, we promote collaborative sustainable development throughout the organisation. At the daytoday level, our internal business functions lead progress on sustainabilityrelated decisions made by the China Board. This process is also steered and monitored by Management Circles across business functions. Through regular reviews, Management Circles ensure that decisions from the Board of Management are translated into actionable items with measurable targets and delivered to the operational level for implementation.

In addition, we are integrating climaterelated risk assessments into our new project investment decisionmaking processes, to take preventive measures at each stage. Our awareness and capacitybuilding efforts are also ongoing. We hold regular workshops and training sessions to empower our associates with the knowledge and tools they need to respond to climate change. business operation, but also to our supply chain and the security of the global society. At BMW Group China, climate change risks are given high priority by the company'stop level - the China Board takes ultimate responsibility for climate change issues, and regularly reviews the impact of climate change on our business to ensure that adaptation actions are integrated into all aspects of operations, and that effective measures are taken to mitigate related risks. We recognise that a thorough analysis and quantification of climate change risks is essential for effective management. As such, since 2021, we have undertaken a climate change risk analysis following the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. This analysis takes into account our business characteristics, future scenarios, geographical locations, and other factors to deeply analyse the climate related risks. In 2022, the BMW Brilliance focused a physical risk assessment on our Shenyang manufacturing base. And the results have been integrated into the corporate risk report of BMW Brilliance, ensuring future assessments and integration with overall risk management. Furthermore, by completing the assessment of transition risks in 2023, we will be able to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of climate change.

INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION 24 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT At BMW Group China, compliance employs awide network consisting of respective compliance management boards, functions and roles to implement an effective Compliance Management System (CMS) at each entity. Based on the threelines model, the CMS is embedded in each entity's overall risk management system. Business departments as the first line are responsible for lawful conduct during the performance of the daily business to ensure compliance requirements and processes are implemented accordingly. Compliance organisation as the second line assists business departments ( first line ) with exercising their compliance responsibility. A multilayer comprehensive compliance organisation is in place consisting of Group Compliance and Divisional Compliance functions aswell as local compliance functions and Compliance delegates ambassadors. Corporate audit as the third line is responsible for independent auditing of compliance structures, processes and systems which supports company management, monitoring functions and operational management. Compliance committees are management boards that supervise and approve activities aswell as manage compliance and reputation risks. The BMW Group China's Compliance Management System (CMS) is based on the Prevent, Detect, Respond Model, which defines specific prevention, monitoring, control and response measures. The CMS is tailored to BMW Group China entities' risk situation and addresses all relevant compliance topics. Relevant compliance topics include antitrust compliance, corruption prevention, fraud prevention, data privacy, export control, antimoney laundering etc. We have developed a wellrounded compliance management system. At the corporate level, the BMW Group Legal Compliance Code integrates the corporate principles of the BMW Group into fundamental rules of conduct. For employees and the public, it offers transparency about key compliance areas. On the basis of this, internal policies and processes are established that reflect the legal requirements for compliance concerns. Compliance risk assessment serves as the foundation for identifying businessspecific compliance risks and mitigation measures. We attach great value to training and compliance awareness promotion. The integration of compliance in our business culture is significantly aided by such communication. At BMW Group China, compliance means much more than simply complying with applicable laws and company rules. It is part of our living culture of integrity and creates a binding framework for all our business activities. Compliance is the foundation for longterm success. It builds trust in our products and brands. It shapes our public image of sustainability. A ROBUST GOVERNANCE STRUCTURETHREESTAGE APPROACH TO COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND COMPLIANCE TOPICS To ensure that the proper accountability structure is in place, the BMW Group China has built a strong organisational framework. At BMW Brilliance, for example, accountability for compliance at shareholder level rests with the Board of Directors (BoD) and its subcommittee, the Audit and Compliance Committee (AC). The Board of Management (BoM) and the Corporate Governance and Compliance Committee (BCC) serve as the principal oversight bodies. To drive a successful implementation, it is a common practice to all BMW Group China entities to have clearly defined roles and responsibilities for compliance. As the first line, business departments are responsible for identifying compliance risks in their daily business, assessing these in line with corporate objectives, and controlling and receding such risks. The role of the Compliance Interface which serves as the bridge between business and central compliance function is created and nominated by all departments. Legal and responsible behaviour is promoted via coordination between the central compliance department, the guiding roles of compliance issues, and business departments. For all entities in BMW Group China, Corporate Governance & Compliance, for example, is the department specifically responsible for overseeing compliance programmes. Legal Affairs, Controlling, Tax, Customs and Export Control, IT, Corporate Quality and Human Resources, among others, are examples of broader compliance steering functions connected to compliance topics.

We focus on comprehensive compliance risk assessments and adhering to China's financial supervisory authority requirements. To ensure streamlined compliance management, the Financial Services has its own compliance governance, and collaborates closely with internal departments and external authorities. A comprehensive compliance management team has also been established as a conduit for communicating and implementing regulatory requirements, supporting overall compliance matters and promoting compliance culture within the Financial Services segment. Compliance awareness is enhanced through various internal communication and training activities, which made an important contribution towards establishing compliance in the corporate culture. This empowers employees to fulfil their personal responsibility for lawful conduct in their areas, while online and classroom sessions meet the needs of different target groups. Strong Tone from the Top compliance messages is an essential element in compliance culture promotion. In 2022, strong and clear tone on importance of compliance and expectations has been delivered in Executive Dialogue by top management across BMW Group China entities through which conveyed the management emphasis and high standard compliance requirement from the top management. The BMW Group China SpeakUP Line Campaign, covering different locations in different cities, gave an impetus for strengthening a culture of compliance and responsibility. This campaign was awarded and recognised by BMW Group in 2022. Annual Compliance Quiz organised by BMW China and BMW China Services, which incorporated both a selflearning package and interactive questions, was another wellrecognised and innovative campaign. On regular basis, compliance communication letters focusing on various compliance topics are sent to all associates or target groups to remind compliance risks and requirements. This also effectively helps to enhance compliance awareness and competence. COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT IN FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENTCOMPLIANCE AWARENESS PROMOTION DATA PRIVACY AND INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT Stringent data protection requirements are taken into account early on when developing BMW Group China products and services. We prioritise transparency, openness, and security based on a robust governance structure. To earn and maintain the trust of our customers and partners, we prioritise effective and efficient management of our data assets through our responsible teams, practices and policies. For us, protecting privacy is strongly aligned with providing excellent customer service and experience. Our policies, standards and processes are designed to ensure that data is secure and accurate, and that the BMW Group China's management of the data complies with China'sand other marketspecific regulatory requirements. 1. 2022 BMW Compliance Interactive Workshop. 1 ITbased compliance systems have been used for transparent and efficient documentation, assessment and approval of compliancerelevant matters. The BMW Group China SpeakUP Line notification is well established and communicated to ensure questions and concerns are addressed properly. Besides, differentiated monitoring levels for reviewing observance and implementation of compliance rules and processes at regular intervals. One of our goals for 2022 is to Make Compliant Behaviour Easier. The decisive Tone from the Top is conveyed down to every level of the organisation through the development of new communication channels, such as light App Compliance Q&A, and the creation of engaging communication materials, etc. BMW Brilliance Compliance Management System Manual, a onestop learning material, was distributed to all Compliance Responsibles and Interfaces of BMW Brilliance and Ling Yue. At BMW Automotive Finance, to increase understanding and awareness of compliance, a quarterly compliance newsletter is emailed to all employees, with content relating to compliance and sustainability.

The amount of steel used is decreasing year by year, thanks to lower scrap rates in workshops and lightweight vehicle designs. 2. Aluminium recycling process in our production. 2 The BMW Group China conducted a comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) analysis of our models, to identify opportunities for CO reduction. In 2022, we completed the BMW 5 Series LCA, with consultancy by the China Automotive Technology and Research Centre (CATARC). Moving forward, we remain committed to calculating and monitoring CO emissions for all models, as part of our dedication to sustainable product development. We are also fully committed to optimising fuel consumption management and achieving peak aerodynamic performance, to enhance fuel efficiency and curtail CO emissions. Accordingly, our vehicles achieved notable reductions in their corporate average fuel consumption in 2022, plummeting from 8. 29 l 100 km to 7. 24 l 100 km for imported models, and from 6. 42 l 100 km to 6. 08 l 100 km for domestic models. Our hard work and dedication have been recognised in China. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) certified the BMW X 5 as a Greendesign Product in 2022. Meanwhile, CATARC deemed our BMW iX 3 a Platinum China Eco Car. The BMW Group China aims to make automobiles that use fewer critical raw materials and have a smaller impact on the environment during their lifecycle. Our primary strategy for advancing the circular economy is a combination of the Secondary First and RETHINK, REDUCE, REUSE, RECYCLE frameworks. Our circular practice is aligned with the initiatives of the BMW Group. These focus on maximising the use of recycled materials in our products, via technological innovation and close collaboration with our partners.

Equipping forklift with retired vehicle HVB atour manufacturing base. 2. Secondary use of HVB in forklift. With the rapid development of NEVs, the retirement volume of highvoltage batteries (HVBs) has been increasing year by year. It is of great significance to implement a sound system for the recycling and utilisation of HVBs in order to protect the ecological environment and ensure the sustainable and healthy development of the NEVs industry. The BMW Group China is working to foster the sustainable, circular and highquality growth of China's highvoltage batteries (HVBs), through collaboration with industry partners. The BMW Group China is consolidating its leadership in circularity with faster expansion of our scope and overall parts remanufacturing capabilities. In 2022, we increased the extent of our parts return, and improved remanufacturing parts research and development in aftersales. This enriched the remanufacturing parts reserve and resulted in the effective recycling of more materials. PIONEERING IN SUSTAINABLE BATTERIES EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF REMANUFACTURED PARTSThe BMW Group China is leading the way in closedloop recycling by partnering with suppliers to reduce China's waste pollution and CO 2 emissions from the mining of new materials. In 2022, we announced anew partnership with Zhejiang Huayou Recycling Technology Co. Ltd. (Huayou Recycling) for closedloop recycling from HVBs retired from our electric vehicles. This partnership will facilitate the recycling of critical materials, including nickel, lithium and cobalt, which will be returned to our battery suppliers for the production of new HVBs. For BMW Group, this is the first time that HVBs raw materials have been recycled in a closedloop system. It is estimated that CO 2 emissions can be reduced by 70 through implementing a closedloop system that, which maximises the resale value of retired HVBs and reduces the need to mine raw materials. Since 2020, the BMW Group and Huayou Recycling have investigated the recyclability of HVBs. Consequently, we were the pioneer in China to successfully reuse HVBs to power forklifts. In 2022, the BMW Group China and Huayou Recycling deepened this cooperation with a project to reuse HVBs indifferent scenarios across the BMW Group China's Shenyang manufacturing base. Forklifts, palletlifting trucks and stationary energy storage are all potential destinations for our retired HVBs, and both parties continue to investigate further applications. Since 2017, the BMW Group China has tracked its HVBs from when they are manufactured to when they are retired and recycled. To achieve closedloop traceability, we have enhanced this tracking to monitor each HVB throughout its lifecycle. This allows us to guarantee that critical raw materials used in manufacturing can be recycled and reintegrated into BMW's production supply chain, thereby achieving HVB circularity. CLOSING THE LOOP FOR HVBSSCALING UP SECONDARY USE OF HVBSENHANCING HVB TRACEABILITY We are working to foster the sustainable, circular and highquality growth of China's HVBs, through collaboration with industry partners.

INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION 42 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 As Beijing confronts excessive traffic congestion, solutions that transform transport are critical. Being part of the solution, the BMW Group China is taking the initiative to work with government and experts to rethink and restructure mobility in an efficient and sustainable way. In December 2022, we released the BMW Lighthouse City - Beijing Vision Picture and shared our vision of smart city of the future mobility. The study's additional value was driven by applying our expertise and cuttingedge technology to urban planning and electrification. CONTRIBUTING TO A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE OF MOBILITYCities face challenges from urbanisation and growing populations. This creates density, congestion, air pollution, noise, CO 2 emissions and scarcity of public space. As a mobility provider, we aim to find innovative solutions that address these challenges and make urban transport more sustainable. Vehiclesharing is a sustainable practice that contributes to lower transport infrastructure, and reduces the environmental impact of travelling. With this in mind, the BMW Group China is leveraging its electric portfolio to offer a wider range of shared mobility options. Herald Leasing our shared mobility services provider has launched car rental services jointly with local dealers in six Chinese cities, promoting shared mobility. For example, customers can enjoy a worryfree rental service with the BMW iX 3 in Hainan Province. Meanwhile, the BMW Group China is actively searching collaboration with domestic rental service providers to fast extend our shared mobility services to more cities and more customers. By offering various car rental options, it not only optimises car owners' car buying and use experiences, but also develops a customeroriented journey that begins with test drives, paves the path to a future of electric, digital, and circular. SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY SHARED MOBILITYRespecting the city's history and culture, the BMW Group China's vision for the future of Beijing's transportation integrates diverse architecture and streetscapes, enabling Beijing to develop towards a lowcarbon, efficient, and intelligent urban transportation system while preserving its urban fabric to the greatest extent. We suggested optimising traffic flow and improving efficiency by promoting multiple transport modes. Our partnership with the Beijing Transport Institute aims to increase the use of designated bus lanes and reduce urban congestions through reservationbased transportation. With digital traffic management methods, reservationbased transport could optimise the allocation of resources, thus easing congestion. We want to promote widespread sustainable mobility solutions, and help make them more accessible. We used gamification to develop sustainable driving behaviour and hence reduce fuel use and CO 2 emissions. The initiative's scope was expanded from electric to petrol vehicles in 2022. We will continue to advance initiatives that empower a sustainable future for mobility, make infrastructure more efficient, and promote smart cities. Meanwhile, we intend to deepen cooperation with the Beijing Transport Institute, to jointly develop digital solutions on traffic management. Our shared mobility service will continue to focus on digital services while progressively expanding its business scope. Keeping exceptional customer service at the centre of our efforts, we will offer more valueadded services, such as Extended T est Drive and Replacement Car, Addon Mobility for BEV Owners, and Courtesy Service.

Typically, production related CO 2 emissions accounts for majority of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 OUR CARBON FOOTPRINTThe BMW Group aims to reduce CO 2 emissions throughout its value chain by 2030. An integral part of that goal is to achieve carbon neutral at our production, in which remarkable progress has been made over years of effort. Since 2019, BMW Group China has transitioned to using renewable energy and attaining 100 renewable electricity 1 atour Shenyang manufacturing base, aswell as at all our 37 nonmanufacturing sites across China in 2022, including the new Spare Parts Distribution Centre in Ningbo. CLIMATE CHANGEgreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which includes emissions from natural gas, purchased electricity and heating. For electricity sector, we have transformed 100 of our production electricity consumption to renewable sources by using onsite photovoltaic (PV) panel, purchasing green electricity from green power purchase agreement (Green PPAs), aswell as through purchasing green certificates (International Renewable Energy Certificate, IREC). For heating sector, we are striving to increase the replacement for lower global warming emission fuel. In 2022 we are gradually increasing the use of natural gas to generate heat, which emits approximately 50 less carbon dioxide in comparison to coal when combusted according to IPCC Emission Factor Database. The remaining GHG emissions from production are mostly from the consumption of natural gas. To overcome this challenge, we are actively exploring and undertaking technical feasibility of alternative energy sources, such as geothermal and biomethane gas, to replace fossil based energy sources in the long run.

INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION 48 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 The transition to lowcarbon in automotive production has put high demands on our energy structure and energy use. In 2022, the BMW Group China's total energy consumption was 1, 189, 231 MWh. Fuel from nonrenewable resources accounted for 25, heating consumption for 21, and electricity consumption for 54. For nonrenewable sources, we aim to minimise pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, working on gradually replacing fossil fuels with more efficient, clean and reliable options. In 2022, we introduced the Distributed Combined Heat and Power system at our new Plant Lydia and Plant Dadong Extension, accelerating the transition from coal boilers to natural gas heating. This is estimated to reduce CO 2 emissions by 50, compared with coal heating. And the electricoven powered was used at Body Shop of Plant Lydia, promoting the switch from natural gas to renewable electricity. We have achieved 100 renewable electricity 1 for all our manufacturing sites as well as all 37 nonmanufacturing sites in China, including our offices, Research and Development Centres, Vehicle Distribution LOWCARBON ENERGY TRANSITION Centres (VDC), Decentralised Dispatch Area (DDA), and Spare Parts Distribution Centres (RDC), among others. Confirming our dedication to renewable energy, our consumption from Green PPAs and onsite solar power has seen significant growth in the past few years. Our goal is to minimise the use of green electricity certificates in the future. Onsite solar is an important source of renewable energy. Through scientific evaluation, we are promoting it at manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sites with suitable geographical conditions. In 2022, our onsite capacity of solar PV installation achieved 74. 4 MWp across our Shenyang base a remarkable increase of 139. 2 from 31. 1 MWp in 2021. In 2022, the total poweredon capacity of solar PV has reached 74. 8 MWp for Shenyang base aswell as Beijing s nonmanufacturing operative site. Meanwhile, electricity generated by onsite solar PV over 64 GWh, which is a significant increase of approximately 280 from last year. Last but not least, we are exploring the feasibility of using renewable heating such as geothermal and electrical boilers to replace purchased heating from coal and natural gas.

INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION 49 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 In line with the ISO 50001 certified Energy Management System, improving energy efficiency is an unwavering part of our production practices. By innovating in energy utilisation, we reduce energy consumption per unit, lower CO 2 emissions, and enhance our agility and resilience to external uncertainties. Achieving ambitious sustainability goals requires a systematic approach to transformation. The integration of digital solutions and data is needed from the very beginning. Our BMW Brilliance production sector proactively engages with digital platforms EnDMS platform goes beyond plantlevel to workshop to monitor energy consumption. Our brandnew Smart Energy System allows the new facilities to manage beyond plant and workshop levels into individual operating areas, to get the uptodate data on energy consumption accompanied of compliance monitoring. With agile engagement and effective data collection, we are best equipped to achieve our ambitious goals. We use intelligent lighting control in multiple shops. It enables safe and energysaving production even with the lights turned off. Meanwhile, we have expanded our heat recovery from the Plant Tiexi to Dadong. When our plants were shutdown, we took proactive measures to reduce the baseload consumption. By adjusting operation schedules, we were able to reduce the equipment output. Our energysaving measures are being tracked and archived throughout the year via the online Standard Tool for Efficiency Applications and Measures (STEAM) platform. In 2022, the recorded 52 measures contributed to more than 15, 034 MWh the energy saving during the year.

We take full responsibility for and strive to lower our products resource footprint. TheRE THINK, REDUCE, REUSE, RECYCLE principle guides us to make the best use of resources in producing our vehicles. This translates to constant action in water resource recovery, waste recycling and treatment, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions reduction. We also apply naturebased solutions to protect biodiversity within our operational boundary. RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENT Climate change impacts put major stress on the supply of freshwater. This matters to us, because painting in vehicle manufacturing is waterintensive. Sophisticated wastewater treatment is required to ensure that effluent is fit for reuse or discharge. WATER STEWARDSHIPWe constantly improve water efficiency in our production, and our aim is to minimise the influence on freshwater consumption from the fluctuation in production volume. A prime example of our water stewardship is stateoftheart recycling at the Plant Dadong Extension. Multiple filtration processes separate, breakdown and remove organic matter and contaminants. This raises wastewater to a quality suitable for reuse in production, enabling us to achieve a closedloop in water management. We have also expanded the reclamation capacity in Paint Shop at the Plant Dadong Extension, saving more than 150, 000 m 3 of water (based on 2022 production). We have developed a benchmark for wastewater recycling and identified scalable measures for greater impacts. We were pleased to be recognised among the first National Industrial Wastewater Recycling Pilot Enterprises in 2022, as awarded by the MIIT. Our annual water consumption per vehicle produced declined fora fifth year, and we will continue to expand water recycling throughout the Shenyang manufacturing base.

INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION 53 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 The BMW Group China is deeply invested in scaling up lowcarbon and multimodal transport such as rail and sea freight to cut emissions and boost efficiency. In 2022, we promoted rail freight to improve logistics efficiency, and made significant progress more than 30 of parts from the Greater Shanghai area reached our Shenyang manufacturing base by train. This shift in transportation modes alone helped us reduce annual CO 2 emissions by 2, 160 t, compared to diesel truck transport. For finished vehicle logistics, the Plant Dadong train station commenced full operation atour Plant Dadong Extension in 2022. This allows for the loading and dispatch of vehicles within the plant and across our Shenyang manufacturing sites via special rail lines. It significantly improved transport efficiency and reduced CO 2 emissions. For aftersales logistics, our lowcarbon strategy is guided by the 2025 Aftersales Strategy. This aims for higher performance with a positive environmental impact. As part of this strategy, we have seta target for aftersales logistics to reduce 1 3 of our CO 2 emissions by 2026. In 2022, we conducted a test run for the South Route as a multimodal transport corridor for the importing of aftersales parts from Europe to China. We also enhanced our percentage of local sourcing, to reduce CO 2 emissions from transport. In 2022, more than 30 of our aftersales parts were sourced locally. To reduce the CO 2 emissions of our logistics, we constantly look for cleaner energy and more efficient modes of transport. ETrucks are our primary choice of clean energy vehicle. In parts logistics, a collaboration with logistics service provider has made us China's leading automobile manufacturer to realise allelectric shortdistance logistics. 39 ETrucks provide intraand interplant shortdistance parts transport across our Shenyang production facilities. This reduces annual CO 2 emissions by 150 t. We plan to expand the use of ETrucks in the long term, to reduce CO 2 emissions in our inbound logistics. Meanwhile, two heavy ETrucks and 14 light ETrucks were used for our finished vehicles and aftersales logistics respectively in 2022. We are also exploring using liquefied natural gas (LNG) trucks with our logistics suppliers and LNG truck manufacturers. In 2022, we sourced new LNG trucks that can load eight finished vehicles by collaborating with carriers and commercial vehicle manufacturers. Sustainable warehouse management is a crucial component of green logistics, which includes the warehouse itself and the efficient management of energy and resources. We proactively pursue green building certifications to enhance our overall green warehouse management. In 2022, we expanded our Spare Parts Distribution Centre network with two additional facilities that meet higher LEED standards. The new Spare Parts Distribution Centre in Ningbo has earned LEED Silver certification, while the new Spare Parts Distribution Centre in Beijing has earned Gold. 100 renewable electricity 3 has been used to power all our Spare Parts Distribution Centres, Vehicle Distribution Centres, Decentralised Distribution Centres, aswell as Relife Point. Our new Spare Parts Distribution Centre in Shenyang will soon be equipped with solar panels, further reducing our carbon footprint. To extend the circular economy, we promote returnable packaging in the value chain by tightening requirements for suppliers. In 2022, returnable packaging became mandatory during tendering for warehouse service contracts atour Spare Parts Distribution Centres in Shanghai and Foshan.

INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION 54 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 As carriers of automobile components, containers play an important role in the supply chain, and directly affect parts quality and operational efficiency. Our packaging planning team continuously seek process optimisation and lean concept throughout the container's lifecycle, contributing to energysaving, CO emissions reduction. Meanwhile, the 4 RE principle RETHINK, REDUCE, REUSE, RECYCLE drives us to implement green packaging. Consequently, in 2022, CO emissions were reduced by 2, 677 t. GREEN PACKAGING Our binsharing and rental scheme, in conjunction with the recycling and reusing of packaging materials, has yielded great results. In 2022, our Plant Dadong, Plant Tiexi, and Plant Lydia, reduced CO 2 emissions by 159 t by reusing rental bins 40, 332 times. We have achieved a 50 increase in the density optimisation of our universal bin packaging density, exceeding our initial target, contributing to a reduction in both packaging and CO 2 emissions (182 tin 2022). In 2023, we will concentrate on lowcarbon transport, including LNG and hydrogenpowered trucks for green logistics in terms of finished vehicles logistics. For aftersales logistics, we will launch the paperless process to all dealers in our aftersales logistics which finally will include most of the internal processes in the Regional Distribution Centres, the transportation to the dealers as well as the inbound processes at the BMW dealerships. In terms of the lowcarbon transition in aftersales logistics, the use of NEV trucks is planned to be extended up to 50 until 2026 for daytime deliveries for dealers in metro areas. Furthermore, the usage of railway and hydrogen trucks for long haul dealer deliveries is under investigation. For green packaging, we will continue to optimise business modules based on the 4 RE principle and make a sustainability mindset the basis for development. We will invest effort in container reuse, recycling and lightweighting, and the development and use of loweremissions containers. Meanwhile, we will continue to drive suppliers to jointly explore innovative projects, to make a significant contribution to green packaging and sustainability. To better leverage the role of suppliers in green packaging, we have strengthened our dialogue on sustainability issues during audits. We collect environmental data from suppliers to understand their sustainable development status. On the other hand, we actively introduce BMW s sustainable concepts and projects, promote consensus on sustainability, and provide guidance for suppliers to take green actions. MAXIMISING BIN USABILITY FORECAST SUPPLIERS COMMUNICATION 2, 677 t CO 2 emissions reduced by implementing 4 RE principle in green packaging. We are actively exploring reducing our raw material consumption for steel bins. This includes innovating bin design, replacing steel with more ecofriendly options, and improving reusability etc. For nonsteel bins, we focus on increasing the proportion of recycled nonsteel material and promoting the flow of nonsteel material recycling. We conducted feasibility studies on expanded polypropylene (EPP), Electro Static Discharge (ESD) EPP, conpearl and thermos, with further materials to be tested in future. Recycling hardware has been deployed in Shenyang and 172 sample bins each made of one t recyclable EPP have been delivered to part suppliers for batch tests. STEEL BIN AND NONSTEEL BIN PROGRAMME Bin Design Container designs for the BMW 5 Series followed BMW Brilliance's latest Bin Concept Construction Guideline. This can realise the standardisation and lighter bin concept, and improve the bin quality at the same time. This have brought more than 73 t CO 2 emissions saving, and we expect that 575 t CO emissions will be deducted from 213 t steel saving. Material Replacement We try touse nonsteel containers with reduced CO emissions, such as Pcontainers and KLT plastic containers. And, in design, we apply finite element analysis to simulate the force analysis on containers. Using compact steel tubes for the BMW X 5, we saved 3. 5 t of steel and reduced 9. 6 t of CO emissions. Reusability Enhancement More than 1, 000 pieces of BMW 3 Series container were reused, reducing CO by 310 t. Standards and processes for steel container reuse were published to facilitate this measure. Green Logistics

It is our priority to increase the use of secondary materials in our products through innovation and close collaboration with suppliers. Our success in 2022 paves the way for the enablement of circularity in the supply chain. By reintroducing scrap steel, scrap aluminium and core raw materials from HVBs into the manufacturing process, we promote the use of secondary material by our suppliers. We also robustly support the recycled precious metal procurement project to encourage technological innovation among suppliers and increase the proportion of secondary materials. In 2022, after two years of intensive qualification, we successfully developed a recycled Platinum Group metal (PGM) supplier. This recycling partnership enabled us to reduce CO 2 by 160, 000 t. For more information on our use of sustainable materials, please refer to Using sustainable materials and Pioneering in sustainable batteries. We are stepping up efforts to drive technological transformation in the supply chain. In 2022, we signed a MoU with the HBIS Group, aimed at establishing a green and lowcarbon steel supply chain. As the first customer of HBIS s green and lowcarbon automotive steel, we are progressively moving towards a 95 reduction in CO 2 emissions. This is supported by the hydrogenbased DRIEAF (Direct Reduced Iron in Electric Arc Furnace) process. Through the transition towards green steel, our goal is to reduce up to 230, 000 t of CO 2 emissions per year from 2026. Recognising the opportunities in steelmaking, our manufacturing facilities in Shenyang will transition to using green automobile steel. Our pioneering approach is having an impact and inspiring industrywide green transformation.

INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPLY CHAINEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION 82 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 OUR CSR APPROACH AND FLAGSHIP PROGRAMMES At BMW Group China, we are guided by the principle of At Home in China to develop and curate our CSR programmes and activities. This means aligning our actions with emerging social agendas and national priorities. In 2022, the Chinese government emphasised the need for highquality development and identified technology, talents, and innovation as the lynchpins to achieve longterm and sustainable growth of China. This has signalled a new norm of development which underscored the importance of CSR as a catalyst for delivering quality development and enabling businesses to address societal challenges. In response to the rapidly transforming social trends, we subscribe to the concept of social innovation and collaboration to create meaningful and longlasting impacts to highquality development. An excellent example of this is the Governmentindustryacademyresearch collaboration model, which we have implemented across our CSR strategic pillars Culture Protection, Environmental and Ecological Conservation, and Social Development. By engaging multiple stakeholders throughout the process of issue analysis, solution building, programme implementation, aswell as impact evaluation, we are able to leverage a wider pool of social resources and maximise our positive social footprints with the participation of more stakeholders who share a common vision with us. The UN Secretary General Ant nio Guterres pointed out in 2020, human is facing a triple environmental emergency biodiversity loss, climate disruption and escalating pollution. We need to rethink the relationship between our business and society, and follow the 3 Pprinciple of people, planet and prosperity for a sustainable development. As an essential measurement of species and ecosystem diversity, a healthy biodiversity helps to ensure a comfortable habitat for all animals on earth. In China, the government has elevated biodiversity conservation toa national strategy and established a biodiversity conservation mechanism led by the government and participated by enterprises and citizens. As a fundamental element of biodiversity conservation, changing the mindset and behaviour of the public, enterprises and social organisations is of great essence. Hence, the BMW Beautiful Homeland Initiative (BBHI) takes public education on biodiversity as the core objective and means. Since the programme s launch in 2021, BBHI has been committed to contributing to China's biodiversity conservation and ecological civilisation, which is now a strong response to the call of the 20 th CPC National Congress for maintaining harmony between humanity and nature in the path towards modernisation and pushing forward Beautiful China Initiative. Education is an essential part of action for the sustainable and equitable use of biodiversity and its conservation. In order to promote local and indigenous knowledge of biodiversity, we have embraced a range of innovative approaches to promote biodiversity education, with the aim of boosting public awareness and laying the groundwork for transformative shifts in behaviour. In August, we already provided three patrol cars and donated two animal rescue vehicles to Liaohekou to facilitate the reserve's management and contribute toa more accurate understanding of the local biodiversity. Based on the three pillars of improving management ability, raising awareness of biodiversity conservation, and promoting publicity and education, we strive to engage more stakeholders to jointly to make a positive impact to the world and bring a brighter future for generations to come. On August 5 th, BBHI Green Summer Camp live streaming was successfully carried out at Liaoning Liaohekou National Nature Reserve, creating a real buzz online. The live streaming was conducted on China Newsweek Weibo and BMW Group We Chat Channels synchronously, and total views on China Newsweek Weibo reached 3. 4 mio.

INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPLY CHAINEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION 107 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 Our assurance was with respect to the year ended 31 December 2022 information only and we have not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods or any other elements included in the BMW Group China 2022 Sustainability Report. The criteria used by the Company to prepare the selected key data in the BMW Group China 2022 Sustainability Report is set out in the basis of reporting in Chapter 6 of the BMW Group China 2022 Sustainability Report (the basis of reporting ). The Board of Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the selected key data in the BMW Group China 2022 Sustainability Report inaccordance with the basis of reporting. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation of the selected key data in the BMW Group China 2022 Sustainability Report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. It is our responsibility to express a conclusion on the selected key data in the BMW Group China 2022 Sustainability Report based on our work. We conducted our work inaccordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information. This standard requires that we plan and perform our work to form the conclusion. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the Company's 2022 selected key data in the BMW Group China 2022 Sustainability Report has been prepared, in all material respects, inaccordance with the basis of reporting. Our work involves assessing the risks of material misstatement of the selected key data in the BMW Group China 2022 Sustainability Report whether due to fraud or error, and responding to the assessed risks. The extent of procedures selected depends on our judgment and assessment of the engagement risk. Within the scope of our work, we have performed the following procedures in Beijing Office, Tiexi Plant, Dadong Plant, Powertrain Plant and Lydia Plant of the Company 1. Interviews with relevant departments of the Company involved in providing information for the selected key data within the Sustain - ability Report; 2. Analytical procedures; 3. Examination, ona test basis, of documentary evidence relating to the selected key data on which we report; 4. Recalculation; and 5. Other procedures deemed necessary. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure nonfinancial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement tech - niques and can affect comparability between entities. Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 2022 se - lected key data in the BMW Group China 2022 Sustainability Report is not prepared, in all material respects, inaccordance with the basis of reporting. Our report has been prepared for and only for the Board of Manage - ment of the Company and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the content of this report. We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirement of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
