NGFS scenarios have been generated by 3 mature integrated assessment models (IAMs) including REMINDMAgPIE. Among these IAMs, REMIND (Regional Model of Investment and Development) is an energyeconomy general equilibrium model linking a macroeconomic growth model with a bottomup engineeringbased energy system model. The scenarios combine macroeconomic agriculture and land use, energy system, water and climate system into a common numerical model, making it possible to analyse the complex and nonlinear dynamics within and between these components. REMIND forecasts carbon dioxide emissions and various climate changerelated factors (such as regional energy consumption) in 12 regions, including China, and provides estimated values for each 5 year period. Reference detail of scenario selection of Ping An is on the NGFS o cial website. To better predict the potential impact of climate risks, Ping An conducts climate scenario analysis based on the scenarios designed by Central Bank and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) in a bid to strengthen the assessment and management of climate risks and plan the roadmap for emission reduction. In 2022, we explored three NGFS climate scenarios, including Nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under Hothouse world, Below 2 C under Orderly, and Divergent net zero under Disorderly. Under such three scenarios, climate policies, hypothetical temperature changes, scenario description and climate risk level are shown below.

By 2060, China's total CO 2 emissions are predicted to approach the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals.

The emission factors are from the Guidelines for the Preparation of Provincial GHG Inventory (Trial ) issued by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the General Rules for Calculation of the Comprehensive Energy Consumption (GB T 25892020) issued by the Standardization Administration. 5 Scope 2 GHG emissions refer to carbon emissions from purchased electricity. The emission factors are based on the national grid emission factor (0. 5810 tCO 2 MWh) provided in the Guidelines on enterprises greenhouse gas emissions accounting and reporting Power generation facilities issued by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment in 2022. 6 Scope 3 emissions are carbon emissions from business paper consumption and employee traveling, where the emission factors are adopted from the China Product Whole Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emission Factor Set (2022) published by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. in FY 2022, Ping An Group's annual travel carbon emissions were 35, 731. 97 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. 7 The carbon emissions disclosure of Ping An's 35 selfowned properties from the public areas were added.

8 The roadmap to carbon neutrality across operations is prepared on the basis of the NDC scenario, where the ambition of each country's climate policy remains is in line with the current level of NDC. The main assumption is that there will be no signi - cant change in the scale of business activities and operating sites within the boundaries of the carbon inventory of operations from 2023 to 2030, that is, carbon emissions will remain consistent with that of 2022 between 2023 and 2030. Ping An mainly operates its business in commercial areas and o ces, and the emissions generated from its operation are mainly from energy consumption in the workplace. We will follow the principles of reducing carbon emissions rst through own e orts and then extern support to conduct green operations, and we strive for achievement of carbon neutrality through a combination of energy conservation, clean energy replacement, and carbon o set. Our measures include (1) Energy conservation. We plan to engage experts specializing in saving energy in buildings to measure and evaluate electricity consumption in the workplace and data centers, design plans for energy conservation and provide guidance on the implementation of measures. We require centralised operation suppliers to save energy and we guide employees to develop the concept and behaviors of lowcarbon. (2) Purchase and generation of green power. We plan to increase the proportion of renewable energy utilisation in annual electricity consumption through purchasing green power and renewable energy certi cates and investing renewable energy power generation facilities. We set the target of 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 renewable energy utilization rate from 2024 to 2030. Therefore, our goal is that 100 of our electricity consumption in our operations will be from renewable energy (the proportion excluding that of renewable energy used by power grids). On the basis of emission reduction, we invest in green assets and purchase emission rights to o set carbon emissions that are unavoidable, ultimately achieving carbon neutrality across our operations by 2030.

Our Measures to Reduce Emissions To reduce emissions in our operations, Ping An advocates a paperless o ce to build a lowcarbon o ce together with our employees. In terms of energy saving, we keep improving our energy consumption system, updating air conditioning, lighting and other facilities, gradually increasing energy e ciency and decreasing electricity consumption in workplaces and data centers, thus reducing carbon emissions in our operations. Green O ce Innovation competition of green operation Ping An strictly abides by laws and regulations, including the Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China. We vigorously promote exploration and innovation in the eld of green operation and encourage all departments to take measures to save energy and reduce emissions in the operation by promoting smart o ce and paperless operation, and constructing green data centers and green buildings, to minimise the impact of our operations on the environment. In response to the green operation policy of the Group, Ping An Life proactively implements green operation. Based on its Jin Guan Jia, an APP, Ping An Life uses digital technologies to provide online closedloop services covering underwriting, insurance claims, purchase of insurance and valueadded services. The APP not only enables Ping An Life to provide professional insurance protection and heartwarming services but also saves lots of paper to reduce carbon emissions, contributing to lowcarbon and green development. Paperless operations reduce the carbon footprint of a piece of policy Scan to learn more about Ping An's achievements in green operations Scan to learn about the carbon footprint of apiece of policy 95 Received Green Operational Innovation Solutions In 2022, Ping An organized the innovation contest of green operation, which includes two separate contests, namely corporate operation and public innovation. The competition was held to encourage subsidiaries to develop appropriate goals, strategies and actions in emission reduction and to reduce energy consumption in a reasonable range. The competition also called on all employees to participate in energy saving and make suggestions for achieving carbon neutrality. In this competition, 20 subsidiaries participated in the corporate operation contest. The public innovation contest attracted nearly 400 participants in groups, whoo ered 95 innovative plans for green operation, covering elds such as operation e ciency improvement, green operation driven by scienti c and technological innovation, workplace recycling and green o ce.
