Based on these deliberations, the Committee provides comments and recommendations to the Board of Directors. While continuously improving the risk governance system, Ping An has incorporated the risk management philosophy into corporate governance and operations and fostered a risk management culture involving the Board of Directors, Management, professional committees and all employees.

Emerging Risk I Climate Risk Emerging Risk II Health and Disease Risk Emerging Risk III Technological Risk Category Environmental Risk Social Risk Social Risk Description Climate change has exerted a serious impact on agricultural production, water resources, ecological environment and energy. In the context of China's carbon neutrality, the environmental pollution attributes of highcarbon industries are becoming increasingly evident, and investors in highcarbon industries are facing serious investment risks. For companies in general, climate change has brought more uncertainties and unprecedented new challenges to their operations and financial performance. The global focus on public health, mental wellbeing, and occupational stress is intensifying. Additionally, factors like industrialization, urbanization, aging populations, generalization of diseases, environmental and lifestyle changes present new challenges for health preservation and advancement. Moreover, the gap between the limited availability of healthcare services and the steadily increasing demand is becoming more evident. As advancements inscience and technology accelerate, businesses increasingly depend on digitalization and smart technologies, heightening the risk of corporate damage from information security vulnerabilities exploited by humanmade or natural threats. Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence introduces new ethical challenges for companies. Major ESG Risk Categories and Corresponding Solutions With close attention paid to ESG risks arising from climate change, social change and policy transformation and with reference to World Economic Forum (WEF)'s Global Risks Report 2023, Ping An systematically identifies ESG risks. At present, among the risks identified by Ping An, the emerging social risks mainly include social demographic change and health, high risk diseases and urbanization and environmental risks mainly include climate disasters, climate change, emerging lowcarbon technologies, raising environmental (carbon emissions) standard, carbon emission policies (carbon taxes, carbon trading, etc.) and regulatory mandatory information disclosure requirements. After evaluating the Group's strategic objectives and business growth and taking into account national policy directives and the concerns of external stakeholders, we have identified three emerging ESG risks that are most closely aligned with Ping An's central sustainability issues from among all recognized emerging societal risks. These are climate risk, technological risk, and health and disease risk. By implementing targeted risk mitigation measures, we aim to ensure the effectiveness of our risk management and avoidance strategies, thereby significantly reducing their potential impact on our business operations.

Metrics and Targets Goal and Roadmap to Carbon Neutrality Given that Ping An mainly operates its business in commercial areas and offices, the GHG emissions generated from its operation are mainly from energy consumption in the workplace. We will follow the principles of reducing carbon emissions first through own efforts and then external support, and we strive for achievement of carbon neutrality through a combination of energy conservation, clean energy replacement, and carbon offset. Our measures include We plan to engage experts specializing in saving energy in buildings to measure and evaluate electricity consumption in the workplace and data centers, design plans for energy conservation and provide guidance on the implementation of measures. We require centralized operation suppliers to save energy. Besides, we raise the awareness of lowcarbon development and encourage lowcarbon behaviors among employees. On the basis of emission reduction, We will invest in green assets and purchase emission rights to offset carbon emissions that are unavoidable, ultimately achieving carbon neutrality across our operations by 2030. We plan to increase the proportion of renewable energy utilization in annual electricity consumption through purchasing green power and renewable energy certificates and investing renewable energy power generation facilities. We set the target of 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 renewable energy utilization rate from 2024 to 2030. Therefore, our goal is that 100 of our electricity consumption in our operations will be from renewable energy (the proportion excluding that of renewable energy used by power grids). 0102030405060 -10 2022 2026 2023 2027 2024 2028 2025 2029 2030 Carbon Reduction Scope 3 Scope 1 and 2 Carbon Offset 2023 Total GHG emissions (operation) 42. 61 Carbon neutrality roadmap (operation) (10, 000 tCO 2 e)Energy conservation Purchase and generation of green power Carbon Offset Ping An Sustainability Report 2023 112 Sustainable Development Strategy Management Sustainable Business Sustainable Operations and Community Sustainable Governance Climate Change and Carbon Neutrality Appendix Opening

Assurance Approach The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement substantially vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Therefore the level of assurance obtained by limited assurance was less than reasonable assurance. We do not provide reasonable assurance that the Selected Indicators in the 2023 ESG Report were disclosed in all material respects inaccordance with the applicable criteria. Our assurance included identifying areas where Selected Indicators for 2023 maybe materially misstated in the ESG Report, designing and implementing assurance procedures to address these identified areas, and obtaining evidence accordingly. The assurance procedures we carried out depend on our professional judgment and risk assessments of assurance. We carried out the following assurance procedures Interviewed the Company's management and staff responsible for information collection, consolidation and disclosure to understand the process of reporting in relation to these Selected Indicators; Tested relevant supporting documents ona sample basis; Performed analytical procedures on Selected Indicators; Recalculated Selected Indicators on a sample basis. Limited Assurance Conclusions Based on the above work performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that would lead us to believe that there is any material misstatement related to the Selected Indicators in the Company's 2023 ESG Report prepared in accordance with the applicable criteria. Use of Independent Limited Assurance Report This independent limited assurance report is solely for the purpose of preparing the Company's 2023 ESG Report, and is not suitable and cannot be used for other purposes. We do not assume responsibility or accept liability to any other person or third party other than the Company's Board of Directors for this report.

If there is any conflict between the translated and Chinese version, the Chinese version shall prevail. 134 Sustainable Development Strategy Management Sustainable Business Sustainable Operations and Community Sustainable Governance Climate Change and Carbon Neutrality Appendix Opening
