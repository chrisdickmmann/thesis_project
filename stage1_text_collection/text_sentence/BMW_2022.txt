6 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPL Y CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION CIRCULARITY TO CLOSE THE LOOP Only by recycling and reusing materials can we ensure a sustainable future.
In 2022, we created a closed-loop for raw materials used in high-voltage batteries (HVBs) by facilitating the recycling of nickel, lithium and cobalt.
Our ongoing efforts to scale up secondary use for retired HVBs and to expand the categories of parts for remanufacturing are bearing good results.
In 2022, by upgrading our facilities, we saved more than 150, 000m3 of water and prevented at least 1, 000 t of waste.
We were pleased to be recognised as one of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology s first National Industrial Wastewater Recycling Pilot Enterprises, and our annual water consumption per vehicle produced declined for a fifth year.
NURTURING OUR PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNITY The quality of an organisation should not just be measured by its economic success but also the social contributions.
A good company has to take care of conditions for employees, workers in the value chain and local communities.
Over the years, we have created more than 25, 800 high-quality jobs in China.
In 2022, our local content suppliers numbered 429, with a total purchasing volume of RMB 73. 47 billion.
Committed to our community, we use innovative and collaborative approaches to direct our corporate social responsibility efforts to China s most urgent social needs.
In 2022, we achieved a historic high of nearly 31. 9 million beneficiaries for our corporate social responsibility activities.
Genuine sustainable leadership spearheads the complete low-carbon and circular transformation of the entire value chain.
We are propelling green innovation and practices by working with industry partners.
As one of the largest OEMs in China, we can leverage the influence to engage with more suppliers about respect of low-carbon, circular and social responsibility, and thereby to advance real changes throughout our value chain.
In this way we are actively engaged with suppliers, mainstreaming values and actions down to raw material producers, with empowerment and connection to platforms such as China Development Research Foundation, to maximise the overall social, environmental and ethical impact.
Mr. Thomas Schmid President, BMW China Services Ltd. Dr. Robert Kahlenberg Senior Vice President, BMW Research & Development China Circularity is a solution one of many needed to address climate change.
Materials re-use, adapting supply chains, re-shaping market perceptions will be challenging but key to ensuring an environmental and circular transition.
Our design is the nascent stages, and the attempts enhance the effective of the implementation of sustainable manufacturing.
To maximise the recyclability and recycled materials used in our vehicles, we investigate each component to reduce emission.
For redesigning and refurbishing, from alloy wheels to seating, we ensure the performance, safety, stability, and consistency.
For instance, on top of our new BMW X1 recycled nylon practices that s synthesised from discarded fish net and worn floor covering, we also have around 150 kg of recycled aluminium had been used in the new BMW i7.

INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPL Y CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION 18 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 The past year presented formidable challenges, as the effects of climate change wrought havoc on our ecosystems and depleted our resources.
This environmental crisis creates obstacles to a global green economy resource and energy shortages, and risk of supply chain disruption.
The automotive industry has a significant impact on the natural environment.
Our sustainable transformation is therefore imperative for tackling global challenges of air pollution, global warming and resource conservation.
Digitalisation and electrification are driving revolutionary change in our product development and production.
These advances are paving the way for a circular economy, thereby mitigating the impact of our value chain on the environment.
Therefore, 2022 compels united action and cooperation and, as a company deeply rooted in China, the BMW Group China stands as an emblem of collaboration and growth.
The 20th National Congress highlighted the need for green development and harmony between humanity and nature.
This principle provides a clear roadmap for our carbon neutral targets.

INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPL Y CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION 19 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 Since our last materiality assessment in 2020, the world has undergone significant changes not only with COVID-19, but also the conflicts in Europe, the growing urgency to take climate actions and the rapidly changing regulatory requirements, and more.
As a result, our stakeholders expectations of our performance have changed, so in 2022 we conducted a refreshed materiality assessment to identify and prioritise the sustainability issues that matter most to our business and key stakeholders.
Our refreshed assessment is based on the double materiality assessment approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methods.
Our final list of material issues was developed via analysis of megatrends and policies, while adhering to the double materiality principle proposed by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).
The materiality matrix was based on 15 interviews and more than 350 questionnaires with eight internal and external stakeholder groups.
The top management reviewed and confirmed the results to ensure their validity and relevance.
The horizontal axis represents the significance of the environmental and social impact of the BMW Group China, and the vertical axis represents relevance to the BMW Group China s business success.
The result is a materiality matrix revealing the nine issues considered most relevant to BMW Group China as well as our stakeholders.
Prioritising Issues We then grouped material issues into our strategic priorities.
Our China Board has reviewed the results of our materiality analysis to validate the importance of each topic, and upon validation, we began crafting detailed action plans to deliver our commitment within each of the priority.

SDG 16
INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPL Y CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION 24 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT At BMW Group China, compliance employs a wide network consisting of respective compliance management boards, functions and roles to implement an effective Compliance Management System (CMS) at each entity.
Business departments as the first line are responsible for lawful conduct during the performance of the daily business to ensure compliance requirements and processes are implemented accordingly.
Compliance organisation as the second line assists business departments ( first line ) with exercising their compliance responsibility.
A multi-layer comprehensive compliance organisation is in place consisting of Group Compliance and Divisional Compliance functions as well as local compliance functions and Compliance delegates ambassadors.
Corporate audit as the third line is responsible for independent auditing of compliance structures, processes and systems which supports company management, monitoring functions and operational management.
Compliance committees are management boards that supervise and approve activities as well as manage compliance and reputation risks.
The CMS is tailored to BMW Group China entities' risk situation and addresses all relevant compliance topics.
Relevant compliance topics include antitrust compliance, corruption prevention, fraud prevention, data privacy, export control, anti-money laundering etc.
At the corporate level, the BMW Group Legal Compliance Code integrates the corporate principles of the BMW Group into fundamental rules of conduct.
For employees and the public, it offers transparency about key compliance areas.
On the basis of this, internal policies and processes are established that reflect the legal requirements for compliance concerns.
Compliance risk assessment serves as the foundation for identifying business-specific compliance risks and mitigation measures.
The integration of compliance in our business culture is significantly aided by such communication.
At BMW Group China, compliance means much more than simply complying with applicable laws and company rules.
It is part of our living culture of integrity and creates a binding framework for all our business activities.
It builds trust in our products and brands.
It shapes our public image of sustainability.
A ROBUST GOVERNANCE STRUCTURETHREE-STAGE APPROACH TO COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND COMPLIANCE TOPICS To ensure that the proper accountability structure is in place, the BMW Group China has built a strong organisational framework.
At BMW Brilliance, for example, accountability for compliance at shareholder level rests with the Board of Directors (BoD) and its subcommittee, the Audit and Compliance Committee (AC).
As the first line, business departments are responsible for identifying compliance risks in their daily business, assessing these in line with corporate objectives, and controlling and receding such risks.
The role of the Compliance Interface which serves as the bridge between business and central compliance function is created and nominated by all departments.
Legal and responsible behaviour is promoted via coordination between the central compliance department, the guiding roles of compliance issues, and business departments.
For all entities in BMW Group China, Corporate Governance & Compliance, for example, is the department specifically responsible for overseeing compliance programmes.
Legal Affairs, Controlling, Tax, Customs and Export Control, IT, Corporate Quality and Human Resources, among others, are examples of broader compliance steering functions connected to compliance topics.
A comprehensive compliance management team has also been established as a conduit for communicating and implementing regulatory requirements, supporting overall compliance matters and promoting compliance culture within the Financial Services segment.
Compliance awareness is enhanced through various internal communication and training activities, which made an important contribution towards establishing compliance in the corporate culture.
This empowers employees to fulfil their personal responsibility for lawful conduct in their areas, while online and classroom sessions meet the needs of different target groups.
In 2022, strong and clear tone on importance of compliance and expectations has been delivered in Executive Dialogue by top management across BMW Group China entities through which conveyed the management emphasis and high standard compliance requirement from the top management.
This campaign was awarded and recognised by BMW Group in 2022.
On regular basis, compliance communication letters focusing on various compliance topics are sent to all associates or target groups to remind compliance risks and requirements.
COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT IN FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENTCOMPLIANCE AWARENESS PROMOTION DATA PRIVACY AND INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT Stringent data protection requirements are taken into account early on when developing BMW Group China products and services.
We prioritise transparency, openness, and security based on a robust governance structure.
Our policies, standards and processes are designed to ensure that data is secure and accurate, and that the BMW Group China s management of the data complies with China s and other market-specific regulatory requirements.
IT-based compliance systems have been used for transparent and efficient documentation, assessment and approval of compliance-relevant matters.
The BMW Group China SpeakUP Line notification is well established and communicated to ensure questions and concerns are addressed properly.
One of our goals for 2022 is to Make Compliant Behaviour Easier.

SDG 9, 12, 13 and 17
INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPL Y CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION 53 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 The BMW Group China is deeply invested in scaling up low-carbon and multi-modal transport such as rail and sea freight to cut emissions and boost efficiency.
In 2022, we promoted rail freight to improve logistics efficiency, and made significant progress more than 30 of parts from the Greater Shanghai area reached our Shenyang manufacturing base by train.
This shift in transportation modes alone helped us reduce annual CO2 emissions by 2, 160 t, compared to diesel truck transport.
For finished vehicle logistics, the Plant Dadong train station commenced full operation at our Plant Dadong Extension in 2022.
This allows for the loading and dispatch of vehicles within the plant and across our Shenyang manufacturing sites via special rail lines.
It significantly improved transport efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions.
For aftersales logistics, our low-carbon strategy is guided by the 2025 Aftersales Strategy.
This aims for higher performance with a positive environmental impact.
As part of this strategy, we have set a target for aftersales logistics to reduce 1 3 of our CO2 emissions by 2026.
In 2022, we conducted a test run for the South Route as a multi- modal transport corridor for the importing of aftersales parts from Europe to China.
In 2022, more than 30 of our aftersales parts were sourced locally.
In parts logistics, a collaboration with logistics service provider has made us China s leading automobile manufacturer to realise all- electric short-distance logistics.
E-Trucks provide intra- and inter-plant short-distance parts transport across our Shenyang production facilities.
This reduces annual CO2 emissions by 150 t. We plan to expand the use of E-Trucks in the long term, to reduce CO2 emissions in our inbound logistics.
Meanwhile, two heavy E-Trucks and 14 light E-Trucks were used for our finished vehicles and aftersales logistics respectively in 2022.
In 2022, we sourced new LNG trucks that can load eight finished vehicles by collaborating with carriers and commercial vehicle manufacturers.
Sustainable warehouse management is a crucial component of green logistics, which includes the warehouse itself and the efficient management of energy and resources.
The new Spare Parts Distribution Centre in Ningbo has earned LEED Silver certification, while the new Spare Parts Distribution Centre in Beijing has earned Gold.
renewable electricity3 has been used to power all our Spare Parts Distribution Centres, Vehicle Distribution Centres, Decentralised Distribution Centres, as well as Relife Point.
Our new Spare Parts Distribution Centre in Shenyang will soon be equipped with solar panels, further reducing our carbon footprint.
T o extend the circular economy, we promote returnable packaging in the value chain by tightening requirements for suppliers.
In 2022, returnable packaging became mandatory during tendering for warehouse service contracts at our Spare Parts Distribution Centres in Shanghai and Foshan.
Both externally sourced and internally generated electricity is renewable, including solar PV, Green PPAs and I-RECs.
INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND MOBILITY SOLUTIONS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPL Y CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION 54 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 As carriers of automobile components, containers play an important role in the supply chain, and directly affect parts quality and operational efficiency.
Our packaging planning team continuously seek process optimisation and lean concept throughout the container s lifecycle, contributing to energy-saving, CO emissions reduction.
Meanwhile, the 4RE principle RE THINK, RE DUCE, RE USE, RE CYCLE drives us to implement green packaging.
Consequently, in 2022, CO emissions were reduced by 2, 677 t. GREEN PACKAGING Our bin-sharing and rental scheme, in conjunction with the recycling and reusing of packaging materials, has yielded great results.
We have achieved a 50 increase in the density optimisation of our universal bin packaging density, exceeding our initial target, contributing to a reduction in both packaging and CO2 emissions (182 t in 2022).
For aftersales logistics, we will launch the paperless process to all dealers in our after-sales logistics which finally will include most of the internal processes in the Regional Distribution Centres, the transportation to the dealers as well as the inbound processes at the BMW dealerships.
In terms of the low-carbon transition in aftersales logistics, the use of NEV trucks is planned to be extended up to 50 until 2026 for day-time deliveries for dealers in metro areas.
For green packaging, we will continue to optimise business modules based on the 4RE principle and make a sustainability mindset the basis for development.
On the other hand, we actively introduce BMW s sustainable concepts and projects, promote consensus on sustainability, and provide guidance for suppliers to take green actions.
This includes innovating bin design, replacing steel with more eco-friendly options, and improving reusability etc.
For non-steel bins, we focus on increasing the proportion of recycled non-steel material and promoting the flow of non-steel material recycling.
We conducted feasibility studies on expanded polypropylene (EPP), Electro-Static Discharge (ESD) EPP, con-pearl and thermos, with further materials to be tested in future.
Recycling hardware has been deployed in Shenyang and 172 sample bins each made of one t recyclable EPP have been delivered to part suppliers for batch tests.
STEEL BIN AND NON-STEEL BIN PROGRAMME Bin Design Container designs for the BMW 5 Series followed BMW Brilliance s latest Bin Concept Construction Guideline.
This can realise the standardisation and lighter bin concept, and improve the bin quality at the same time.
And, in design, we apply finite element analysis to simulate the force analysis on containers.
Using compact steel tubes for the BMW X5, we saved 3. 5 t of steel and reduced 9. 6 t of CO emissions.
Reusability Enhancement More than 1, 000 pieces of BMW 3 Series container were reused, reducing CO by 310 t. Standards and processes for steel container reuse were published to facilitate this measure.

This means aligning our actions with emerging social agendas and national priorities.
In 2022, the Chinese government emphasised the need for high-quality development and identified technology, talents, and innovation as the lynchpins to achieve long-term and sustainable growth of China.
This has signalled a new norm of development which underscored the importance of CSR as a catalyst for delivering quality development and enabling businesses to address societal challenges.
In response to the rapidly transforming social trends, we subscribe to the concept of social innovation and collaboration to create meaningful and long-lasting impacts to high-quality development.
An excellent example of this is the Government-industry-academy-research collaboration model, which we have implemented across our CSR strategic pillars Culture Protection, Environmental and Ecological Conservation, and Social Development.
As an essential measurement of species and ecosystem diversity, a healthy biodiversity helps to ensure a comfortable habitat for all animals on earth.
In China, the government has elevated biodiversity conservation to a national strategy and established a biodiversity conservation mechanism led by the government and participated by enterprises and citizens.
Hence, the BMW Beautiful Homeland Initiative (BBHI) takes public education on biodiversity as the core objective and means.
Since the programme s launch in 2021, BBHI has been committed to contributing to China s biodiversity conservation and ecological civilisation, which is now a strong response to the call of the 20th CPC National Congress for maintaining harmony between humanity and nature in the path towards modernisation and pushing forward Beautiful China Initiative.
In order to promote local and indigenous knowledge of biodiversity, we have embraced a range of innovative approaches to promote biodiversity education, with the aim of boosting public awareness and laying the groundwork for transformative shifts in behaviour.
On August 5th, BBHI Green Summer Camp live streaming was successfully carried out at Liaoning Liaohekou National Nature Reserve, creating a real buzz online.

Emissions from the upstream chain and disposal processes are based on the carbon footprint of representative vehicles from the BMW Group s product lines, calculated by using the LCA tool GaBi provided by Sphera which took into account Chinese market factors in the calculation.
The increase in this figure is mainly due to the adjustments to emissions factors and reporting scope expansion.
Leveraged on improved data traceability, we managed to track and report CO2 emissions from local aftersales logistics (Spare Parts Distribution Centres to local dealerships) and from international outbound logistics of exported vehicles (China ports-global dealers) in 2022.
The fleet emissions are extrapolated from the average fleet CO2 emissions and an assumed average mileage of 200, 000 km.
The year-on-year reduction for this figure was mainly due to the implementation of the sludge drying project in Plant Dadong in which the water content of sludge has been reduced and leading to a reduction in waste for disposal per vehicle.
Figures for Employees in Shanghai and other cities of BMW Brilliance in 2018-2021 were disclosed in the Employees in Beijing category.
