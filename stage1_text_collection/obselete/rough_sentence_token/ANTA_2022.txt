ANTA Sports Products Limited ESG Report 202236CREATING VALUE THROUGH WIN-WIN COOPERATION Sustainable Sourcing of Raw Materials Responsible Sourcing Following the country s policy direction of green development, we are actively fulfilling our responsibility of environmental protection, exploring green materials in the value chain, and gradually increasing the sourcing of sustainable raw materials, in order to reduce the environmental impact of our products throughout their life cycle, and move toward the strategic goal of using sustainable raw materials for the manufacturing of 50 of our products by 2030.
We are committed to promoting a green supply chain and prioritizing the use of raw materials, products and services that are resource and environment-friendly, safe and healthy.
Cotton, leather and other materials and their finished products are widely used in our apparel and footwear products, but the cultivation and production of these materials have both environmental and social impacts cotton cultivation and processing not only requires large amounts of water, but the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers may also cause deterioration of soil and water quality in the surrounding environment; the leather production process generates a large amount of heavy metals, organic solvents and waste gases, and other hazardous wastes.
Their leakage or improper disposal will increase the environmental burden and health threat to the society.
Therefore, in order to reduce the potential environmental and social impacts of plantation and production, we commit to increase the sourcing of responsible leather and cotton materials, and prioritize the selection of suppliers certified by the Leather Working Group, the Global Organic Textile Standard and other relevant international standards.

The scenario-based assessment of the physical environment and socioeconomic environment lays the foundation for identifying key climate parameters, and provides the basis for further identifying the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks on our business, strategy and financial planning.
ANTA Sports Products Limited ESG Report 202254Climate Scenario Construction Name of scenarioDescription of scenario Scenario of reference 1. 5 C scenario Physical impact Temperature rise is kept within 1. 5 C, climate impacts can be clearly felt globally, but the frequency and intensity of severe climate events begin to stabilize at a new normal.
Socioeconomic impact Climate targets and policies get strengthened in all countries, companies face more stringent compliance requirements on carbon reduction targets, green electricity use, carbon price mechanism coverage, and low-carbon procurement, global energy transformation picks up pace and a power system driven mainly by clean electricity takes shape in 2030, consumers start to pay attention to the carbon information of products and become more conscious of sustainable consumption.
IPCC SSP1-1. 9 NGFS Net Zero 2050 WBCSD 1. 5 C Societal Transformation Scenario 2 C scenario Physical impact Temperature rise is kept within 2 C, climate impacts can be clearly felt globally, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather increases significantly before and after 2030, some high-risk areas are clearly affected by climate events, but governments are taking systematic adaptation measures to deal with the impact.
Socioeconomic impact Climate targets and policies get strengthened in all countries, voluntary carbon reduction targets are issued by most enterprises, the compliance requirements for energy-intensive industries become more stringent, the carbon pricing mechanism is not expanded to more industries, global energy transformation picks up pace, consumers are more conscious of sustainable consumption but less capable of making consumption.
IPCC SSP2-2. 6 NGFS Delayed Transition WBCSD Forecast Policy Scenario 3 C scenario Physical impact Temperature rise is kept within 3 C, climate impacts can be strongly felt globally, with notable increase in frequency and intensity, climate change impacts most regions and populations in the world, and the response measures taken by governments are temporary rather than systematic.
Socioeconomic impact The climate targets and policies adopted by countries have not been further strengthened, only some enterprises have issued voluntary carbon reduction targets, and the supply chain is not sufficiently motivated to cut carbon emissions; global energy transition is slow, clean energy is not sufficiently available, and the purchase of non-essential consumer goods by consumers is significantly reduced.

55 ANTA Sports Products Limited ESG Report 2022In accordance with the TCFD and Guidance on Climate Disclosures, we have assessed the physical risks (including acute risks with short-term impacts and chronic risks caused by long-term shifts in climate patterns) and transition risks that may affect ANTA Sports, identified five potential physical risks in two categories and 13 potential transition risks in four categories, and produced a list of potential climate risks, which will be used as an important input for further assessing the impact of climate-related material risks on our business.
List of Potential Climate Risks Type of riskInfluencing factorImpact on business, strategic and financial planning Physical risk Acute riskTyphoonFujian province is a typical landing spot of typhoons.
Increased frequency of floods may disrupt highway traffic and transportation across regions, potentially jeopardizing the stable operation of logistics and transportation.
Physical risk Chronic riskExtreme changes in rainfall patterns and weather patternsIncreased frequency of extreme weather patterns such as floods, typhoons and thunderstorms caused by climate change will have a significant impact on agriculture.
This long-term change will visibly affect the planting patterns and purchase prices of natural fibers such as cotton, which will in turn lead to an increase in operating costs.
Average temperature riseThe rise in average temperature caused by climate change may affect the yield of agricultural products, which may lead to a reduction in production of natural fibers such as cotton in the long term, pushing up the purchase price and eventually affecting corporate income.
The increase in hot weather may lower the work efficiency of employees and jeopardize their health and safety, pushing up the expenses of high-temperature subsidies and medical care as well as may suppress public demand for outdoor sports, resulting in lower consumer demand for outdoor products.
ANTA Sports Products Limited ESG Report 202256PROMOTING ENVIRONMENT-FRIENDLY AND GREEN DEVELOPMENT Type of riskInfluencing factorImpact on business, strategic and financial planning Transition riskPolicy and legal riskHigher pricing for GHG emissionsUnder a carbon-reduction scenario, the consumer goods sector may be further incorporated into the carbon pricing mechanism in China s carbon trading market; the EU is already planning to issue a carbon border tax requirement for the textile industry.
A carbon price could set the direction for the market, and encourage low-carbon energy consumption and innovation in low-carbon technologies.
If the Company emits more GHG emissions than it is allowed to, it will have to incur extra operating costs.
Enhanced emissions reporting obligationsANTA Sports is listed on the HKEX.
Existing requirements and regulation of products and servicesThe existing requirements and regulation of products and services may drive up the cost of professional training for the Company s sales personnel.
Government or industry associations may impose increasingly stringent requirements on the energy consumption standards of the products and the carbon intensity of the industry, including possible requirement for the carbon footprint label of products or carbon intensity per unit weight of product, or even requirement for the elimination of high-carbon products.
Transition riskTechnology riskFailure on new technology investment The potential of transferring to industry with clean and low-carbon technology may lead to extra investment.
Cost of low-carbon technology transitionIn recent years, more and more electric and even hydrogen-driven vehicles have been used in freight transport.
The replacement and upgrade cost of the freight vehicles may have an impact on the cost of this particular link on the value chain segment, and eventually pass on to ANTA Sports.
ANTA Sports Products Limited ESG Report 2022Type of riskInfluencing factorImpact on business, strategic and financial planning Transition risk Market riskChanges in customer behaviorOur customers may seek more environmentally friendly products and service experiences due to consumer preferences or policy requirements.
Due to ever more rigorous requirements of environmental protection and increased policy actions, the demand for low-carbon transformation of raw materials and energy is becoming higher and higher.
Suppliers will transfer the cost of environmental protection to the downstream suppliers, and the cost of energy consumption, raw materials etc., will increase due to requirement of low-carbon transitions.
Transition riskReputation riskChange in consumer preferenceWith changing public perception and consumer preference, more attention will be paid to the low-carbon attributes of goods, which may lead to an increase in the demand for low-carbon products and affect the preferred forms of sales, such as the green design and mode of promotion adopted by the stores.
Increased stakeholder concerns and negative feedbackMore and more investors are adopting ESG investment principles, such as responsible investment principles, and closely following companies climate change actions.
In order to cope with the risks associated with climate change, we continue to expand our efforts and measures in areas such as biodiversity protection based on the concept of coexistence between corporate development and the environment; introduce carbon inventories to promote green and low-carbon development in the value chain and areas of consumption; set up contingency plans for extreme weather and natural disasters such as typhoons and earthquakes to ensure stable production and operations.
Targets Based on the assessment of climate change risks and potential opportunities and our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, we have, in line with our development strategy, formulated and actively promoted the 1 3 5 strategic goals for achieving mutualism with the environment, and will continue to promote clean and low-carbon transformation of our business, push forward green and low-carbon development in the value chain, and enhance our climate resilience and sustainable competitiveness.
