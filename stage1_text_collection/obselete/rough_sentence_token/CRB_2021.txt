Our launched projects include Water-saving transformation of packaging bottle washer; Heat balance transformation of packaging sterilization machine; Steam condensate water recycling and comprehensive utilization of the whole plant, etc.
Besides, we also launched various measures for water recycling, such as Recycling of self-produced steam condensate water; Cooling recycled water from filling machine vacuum pump; Recycling of saccharified wort cooling hot water; Recycling of water from Clean in Place (CIP); Recycling of reverse osmosis (RO) concentrated water; Reuse of serial water, etc.
Through the aforesaid water saving technologies and processes, the total water consumption of the Group decreased from 38, 781 thousand cubic metres in 2016 to 30, 837 thousand cubic metres in 2021; the total water intensity per kilolitre output decreased from 3. 25 cubic metres in 2016 to 2. 74 cubic metres in 2021, which is leading among the domestic industry peers and comparable to the international peers.
The underground water consumption of the Group decreased from over 15 million cubic metres in 2016 (representing approximately 41 of the total water consumption) to over 3. 8 million cubic metres in 2021 (representing approximately 13 of the total water consumption), with the cumulative reduction of underground water consumption of more than 11. 20 million cubic metres.
The water consumption data of the Group in 2020 and 2021 is set out as follows
74 China Resources Beer (Holdings) Company Limited 2 5 (COD) pH sewage disCharge ManageMent In respect to sewage treatment, the Group strictly complied with the national or local sewage discharge standards, formulated the internal control index in compliance with regulations and requirements, managed and controlled sewage discharge risks.
The Group regards the environmental performance of plants as one of the important criteria for capacity optimization consideration and shuts down plants that discharge sewage into natural waters step by step.
Or, with strong support from the local government, we continuously invest in the pipeline transformation so that sewage could be discharged into the centralized treatment facilities for urban sewage treatment and less would be discharged into nature waters.
In 2021, Deyang Plant and Huludao Plant whose sewage was discharged into natural waters have been closed, while Dongcheng Plant has switched from discharging into natural waters to discharging into centralized municipal sewage treatment.
As of the end of 2021, CR Beer had only 2 plants (2020 5 plants) that discharged its sewage into natural waters.
Both plants have been equipped with sewage treatment systems, and the sewage shall only be discharged into natural waters after being treated to reach the standard set locally.
In addition, devices for the inspection and testing of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorus and total nitrogen have been installed at sewage outlets at each plant, which is connected to the local ecological and environmental protection supervision department for real- time data transfer of indicators such as pH value and discharging volume to ensure accurate data and effective supervision.

Benefitted from this, the amount of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen emissions of the Group being discharged into natural waters recorded a year-on-year decrease of 43. 2 and 31. 8, respectively.
Some of the year-on-year changes may not be equal to the results of direct calculation of the figures presented, as the figures presented are rounded, but the percentage changes are calculated based on the raw data.
resourCeful utiliZation of beer waste water The Group actively promoted the resourceful utilization of beer waste water in respond to the new policy stated in National Water Pollutant Discharge Standard that sewage with better biochemical properties discharging into centralized sewage treatment facilities can apply negotiated discharging limit.
Therefore, the Group has been actively enhancing the communication and co-operation between each plants and downstream sewage treatments facilities to promote the implementation of negotiated discharging limit.
On the one hand, it can effectively recycle brewery wastewater, reduce the cost of enterprise sewage treatment, and reduce carbon emissions.
On the other hand, downstream sewage treatments facilities can reduce the addition of nutrients and save the cost of purchasing carbon source externally, which can stabilize water quality while lowering operational costs.
As of the end of 2021, the subsidiary plants in Suzhou, Changzhou, Binzhou, Mianyang, Yichang and other cities had implemented negotiated discharging limit while plants in Qinhuangdao and other cities are in active communication and co-ordination.
In particular, it focuses on the requirements for the evaluation of all indicators of sewage, the change of the total amount limit, and the evaluation of economic benefits.
The project researched on how to recycle and utilize resources according to the characteristics of brewery wastewater, aiming to reduce cost and increase efficiency.
The laboratory experiment of the project has been initially completed, following with two pilot tests carried out in Foshan Plant and Yantai Plant of CR Beer.
In the future, the Group will continue to sort out beer production projects, strengthen internal energy efficiency management, continue to improve water efficiency, increase water recycling, and strengthen watersaving renovations.
In addition, we will continue to study the comprehensive utilization of brewery wastewater effectively, turning waste into treasure and recycling resources effectively.
V) PACKAGING MATERIAl AND WASTE TREATMENT The Group stays committed to enhancing the management of the waste and packaging material to reduce the use of resources.
The waste generated during the Group s operation mainly includes distiller s grains and waste yeasts, while the packaging materials mainly include glass bottles, cans, cartons and plastic films.
In order to properly dispose of the above resources, we have formulated a series of management regulations such as the Solid Waste Management System of CRSB and the Regulations on the Management of By-products and Waste Materials of CRSB.

By implementing the reduction of waste at source, achievements have been made as follows In 2021, the Group successfully carried out the production and use test of the 330 milliliters Heineken lightweight bottle in the Jiashan Plant.
Under the premise of ensuring the quality and capacity of the beer bottle remain unchanged, the lightweight beer bottle of this project achieved a 17 reduction in bottle weight with energy consumption and carbon emissions per unit of beer bottle decreased by 18.
The data on the Group s consumption of product packaging materials in the past two years are set out as follows Since purchasing new glass bottles would make certain impact on the environment, we increase the recycling of glass bottles put them into use again after cleaning and disinfection.
Approximately 80 of the glass bottles used by the Group in 2021 were recycled and approximately 20 were newly purchased.
Some of the year-on-year changes may not be equal to the results of direct calculation of the figures presented, as the figures presented are rounded, but the percentage changes are calculated based on the raw data.
China Resources Beer (Holdings) Company Limited 80 3. 3 4. 7 100 49 47 800 Among the packing materials currently used by the Group, caps, cans and cartons are all recyclable materials; glass bottles are reusable materials.
We cleaned and sanitized the recycled glass bottles and reused them.
In 2021, the use of glass bottles decreased by 3. 3 year-on-year and the use of aluminum cans increased by 4. 7 year-on-year.
In addition, for the packaging materials that fails to pass the internal quality control, the plant recycles 100 of the discarded aluminum cans, glass slags and waste cartons, and puts them back into the production process to achieve zero waste in the production process.
In response to the new national standard of Beer Bottle implemented officially on 1 August 2021, the national call for energy saving and emission reduction and the Group s strategic promotion of high-quality product, the Group has further improved its quality control system for the recycling glass bottle in whole flow.
Various initiatives such as refining the standards for recycled bottles, carrying out extended quality management on recycled bottles, promoting the establishment of the capillary-type rapid bottle-returning channels and replacing bag packaging with innovative polypropylene box for returning transportation are promoted and implemented effectively.
For example, we require upstream suppliers to reduce the use of individual packaging during the transportation of malt, so as to reduce the packaging materials generated when the Group imports raw materials.
In 2021, the bulk transportation ratio of the Group s imported malt using individual packaging continued to decrease from 49 in 2020 to 47, saving a total of 8 million packaging bags.

In 2021, the general solid waste integrated utilization rate of the Group was 99. 4, representing an increase of 2 percentage points over the same period last year.
The relevant data is as follows There is no significant amount of hazardous waste generated during the Group s production process.
The Group generated approximately 280. 4 tons (2020 288. 6 tons) of hazardous waste in 2021, all of which were entrusted to external professional agencies for environmentally friendly disposal in accordance with relevant national requirements.
In 2021, the recycle rate of dried distiller s grains and dried waste yeasts remained stable at 100.
Recycling not only reduces the generation of wastes but also creates an economic value of approximately RMB420 million for the Group, of which the recycled distiller s grains and waste yeast contribute RMB250 million and RMB80 million respectively.
The data of recyclable waste in the past two years are as follows
80 China Resources Beer (Holdings) Company Limited (GPS) ProPerly disPose of wastes In 2021, the Group formulated the Solid Waste Management System of CRSB in accordance with the newly amended Law of the PRC on the Prevention and Control of Environment Pollution Caused by Solid Wastes to manage solid wastes more effectively.
The Group s waste reduction efforts mainly follow the principles of reduction, resourcefulness and harmlessness.
We have implemented green operation model covering entire process from procurement to sale.
The units for hazardous waste treatment, disposal and transport were selected through public tender by which the units with relevant capacity were selected conduct disposal and transport, and the transfer registration was made in accordance with relevant laws and regulations of the country.
In order to effectively monitor the transport process and the final disposal location, factories adopted Global Positioning System (GPS) positioning on transport vehicles, sampling in the transport process, route tracking, etc.
In addition, we continue to implement the Regulations on the Management of By-products and Waste Materials of CRSB to require that different solid wastes shall be stored by category.
Through the detailed regulation for the whole process of recycling, classification, identification, storage, maintenance, sale, and treatment of waste materials, we meet the three prevention standards, that is, leakage prevention, loss prevention and scattering prevention.
In terms of recycling distiller s grains, contract vendors are required to adopt protective measures for their trucks to prevent leakage or dripping.
In order to ensure that disposal is compliant with pertinent regulations, we also check and verify the process of solid waste disposal on a monthly basis, and are committed to achieving managed and supervised closed-loop control and management of waste and obsolete material recycling.
