This ensures proactive anticipation, effective decision-making, and active engagement in climate change action.
Strategy In order to better understand the impact of climate change on our business, we carefully assess the physical risks, transition risks and opportunities of climate change on business marketing of the significant component of our business.
In relation to our business segments and with reference to the climate scenarios proposed by the United Nations IPCC, NGFS and other institutions, we have constructed three climate scenarios, i. e. 1. 5 C scenario, 2 C scenario and 3 C scenario, for the short-term (0-5 years), medium-term (6-10 years) and long-term (up to 2050) timeframes.
The scenario-based assessment of the physical environment and socioeconomic environment lays the foundation for identifying key climate parameters, and provides the basis for further identifying the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on our business, strategy and financial planning.
The impact of climate-related risks and opportunities were assessed respectively for short-term, medium-term and long-term to determine priority for further risk management.
ANTA Sports Products Limited ESG Report 202354 GREEN DEVELOPMENT FOR ECOLOGICAL CONSERVATIONClimate Scenario Construction Name of scenarioDescription of scenario Scenario of reference 1. 5 C scenario- Physical impact Temperature rise is kept within 1. 5 C, climate impacts can be clearly felt globally, but the frequency and intensity of severe climate events begin to stabilize at a new normal.
Socioeconomic impact Climate targets and policies get strengthened in all countries, companies face more stringent compliance requirements on carbon reduction targets, green electricity use, carbon price mechanism coverage, and low-carbon procurement, global energy transformation picks up pace and a power system driven mainly by clean electricity takes shape in 2030, consumers start to pay attention to the carbon information of products and become more conscious of sustainable consumption.- IPCC SSP1-1. 9 - NGFS Net Zero 2050 - WBCSD 1. 5 C Societal Transformation Scenario 2 C scenario- Physical impact Temperature rise is kept within 2 C, climate impacts can be clearly felt globally, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather increases significantly before and after 2030, some high-risk areas are clearly affected by climate events, but governments are taking systematic adaptation measures to deal with the impact.
Socioeconomic impact Climate targets and policies get strengthened in all countries, voluntary carbon reduction targets are issued by most enterprises, the compliance requirements for energy-intensive industries become more stringent, the carbon pricing mechanism is not expanded to more industries, global energy transformation picks up pace, consumers are more conscious of sustainable consumption but less capable of making consumption.- IPCC SSP2-2. 6 - NGFS Delayed Transition - WBCSD Forecast Policy Scenario 3 C scenario- Physical impact Temperature rise is kept within 3 C, climate impacts can be strongly felt globally, with notable increase in frequency and intensity, climate change impacts most regions and populations in the world, and the response measures taken by governments are temporary rather than systematic.
Socioeconomic impact The climate targets and policies adopted by countries have not been further strengthened, only some enterprises have issued voluntary carbon reduction targets, and the supply chain is not sufficiently motivated to cut carbon emissions; global energy transition is slow, clean energy is not sufficiently available, and the purchase of non-essential consumer goods by consumers is significantly reduced.- IPCC SSP2-4. 5 - NGFS Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)
55 ANTA Sports Products Limited ESG Report 2023Identification of Climate Risks and Opportunities Type of riskInfluencing factorImpact on business, strategic and financial planning Physical riskAcute riskTyphoonFujian, China, Guangdong, China and other southeast coastal areas are typical landing spots of typhoons.
Some products may face disruptions in logistics and transportation, leading to delayed deliveries or damages.
Increased frequency of floods may disrupt highway traffic, jeopardizing the logistics and transportation of certain products.
Chronic riskExtreme changes in rainfall patterns and weather patternsIncreased frequency of extreme weather patterns such as floods, typhoons and thunderstorms caused by climate change will have a significant impact on agriculture, may result in increased costs for natural fibers such as cotton.
Extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall, may also affect product quality, leading to potential losses in the Group s operating revenue.
Average temperature riseThe rise in average temperature caused by climate change may affect the yield of agricultural products, which may lead to a reduction in production of natural fibers such as cotton in the long term, pushing up the purchase price and eventually affecting corporate revenues; The increase in hot weather may lower the work efficiency of employees and jeopardize their health and safety, pushing up the expenses of high-temperature subsidies and medical care as well as may suppress demand for outdoor sports, resulting in lower consumer demand for outdoor products.
In accordance with the TCFD, the ISSB, and the HKEX Reporting Guide, we conducted group-wide business assessment for risks and opportunities followed by departmental interviews during the financial year.
This multi-disciplinary management program identified and analyzed climate change-related risks and opportunities based on the actual business units and operations of the Group.
This includes two categories of four potential physical risks, four categories of eight potential transition risks, and four categories of eight potential opportunities identified through a combination of existing management measures and improvement directions.
ANTA Sports Products Limited ESG Report 202356 GREEN DEVELOPMENT FOR ECOLOGICAL CONSERVATIONType of riskInfluencing factorImpact on business, strategic and financial planning Transition riskPolicy and legal riskHigher pricing for GHG emissionsUnder a carbon-reduction scenario, the consumer goods sector may be further incorporated into the carbon pricing mechanism in Mainland China s carbon trading market; the EU is already planning to issue a carbon border tax requirement for the textile industry.
A carbon price could set the direction for the market and encourage low-carbon energy consumption and innovation in low-carbon technologies.
If the Group emits more GHG emissions than it is allowed to, it will incur extra operating costs in the long term.
Enhanced emissions reporting obligationsANTA Sports is listed on the HKEX.
Existing requirements and regulation of products and servicesThe requirements and regulation of products and services may drive up the cost of professional training for the Group s sales personnel; Government or industry associations may impose increasingly stringent requirements on the energy consumption standards of the products and the carbon intensity of the industry, including possible requirement for the carbon footprint label of products or carbon intensity per unit weight of product, or even phasing out high-emission products.
Technology riskFailure on new technology investmentAt various stages, including the product design phase, the failure of investments in clean and low-carbon technologies may lead to extra investment for the Group.
Cost of low-carbon technology transitionAs a leading company, ANTA Sports is expected to undertake greater obligations of carbon emission reduction and in the product design phase will face greater energy saving and carbon reduction technology investment; in addition, new technologies and processes required for low-carbon production will lead to the replacement and iteration of existing equipment, which will bring down the value of corporate assets.
Market riskRising costs of raw materialsThe increased frequency of floods, typhoons, thunderstorms, and extreme high low temperatures weather caused by climate change will push up the prices of natural fibers and other raw materials required for our production, which will increase the procurement cost of raw materials and may ultimately affect our revenue.

Consumers are inclined to purchase more environment-friendly and sustainable products and services.
Increased stakeholder concerns and negative feedbackAn increasing number of investors are highly concerned about corporate climate change actions in line with ESG investment criteria such as the Principles for Responsible Investment, and are increasingly concerned about corporate climate risk and carbon emission performance and targets.
OpportunityResource efficiencyAdopting more efficient transportation methodsBy optimizing the logistics and transportation structure and routes, implementing new energy vehicle procurement for transportation to enhance logistics efficiency and reduce energy consumption.
Recycling and reuseBy embedding requirements for circularity and low carbon throughout the entire life cycle of the product, including packaging design, production, use, and recycling, we can effectively reduce the product s carbon footprint and raw material consumption.
This not only lowers the procurement costs of raw materials but also maximizes the reduction of envir onmental impact.
Transition to more efficient buildingsBy improving the energy resource efficiency of both new and existing buildings, we can effectively reduce energy resource consumption and decrease operational costs.
For instance, adopting green building design standards, including LEED, for logistics and warehouse facilities enhances climate change adaptability, leading to reduced mid-to-long-term operational expenditures.
Using more efficient production and distribution processesBy adopting high-energy-efficient production equipment and processes, establishing green factories and digitally intelligent workshops, and optimizing process management and operational efficiency, we can reduce GHG emissions.
ANTA Sports Products Limited ESG Report 202358 GREEN DEVELOPMENT FOR ECOLOGICAL CONSERVATIONRisk Management We have incorporated climate risk management into our strategy and enterprise risk management, and the Sustainability Committee is responsible to coordinate the implementation of climate-related risk management in all departments and business units.
For the purpose of comprehensive management of risks and opportunities associated with climate change, we conduct extensive research on climate change trends in the operational regions of us, industry risk reports, and other relevant data.
Through interviews and surveys, we integrated multi-disciplinary departments to conduct group-wide analysis of the potential impacts of climate change on business operations, as well as the potential financial consequences with assessment criteria including likelihood, impact, time-horizon (short-term, medium-term and long-term) and so on.
This approach allows us to subsequently rank identified climate-related risks and opportunities based on their significance and further determine priority.
