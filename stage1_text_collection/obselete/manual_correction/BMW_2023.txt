The reporting and verification for the data along the value chain remains challenging in the past as most of the reporting was voluntary and certain regulations3 might pose difficulties for firms to seek detailed information from an n-Tier supply chain.
One element of the solutions is to standardise an internationally harmonised carbon accounting and reduction approach.
Under such framework conditions, the GHG Protocol4 standard rightly allows companies to supplement measured data or supplier-specific data with industry-average data from independent data providers.
While this enables guesstimates which provides a good start, due to the lack of internationally recognised accounting method, the use of secondary data and industry average data oftentimes lead to high variability of results of same products and inaccurate accounting of supply chain decarbonisation effort.
The continued reliance on regional or data providers default-average values could pose challenges to reflect and make mitigation deductions measurements accountable.
Such framework needs to allow the firm to report emissions unique to its supply chain taking into account the mitigation results achieved by the firm and its suppliers.
As a uniform data rulebook and database is crucial step to provide a cooperative environment where transparent, reliable, and complete CO 2 data can be exchanged and respectively be measured and reported across the entire value chain.
BMW Group supports and drives forward pursuing primary data instead of secondary and average emission factor for product carbon footprint calculation at corporate level.
In turn, sustainability action takers can fully engage the effort to contribute the part on the journey of decarbonisation.
BMW CARBON ACCOUNTING POSITION Introduction Scientists are observing changes in across the Earth s climate system, according to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2021) report1.
However, strong and sustained reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and other greenhouse gases would limit climate change.
External environment & challenges Following the global consensus of Paris Agreement, numerous countries and governments, investors, and companies are increasingly adopting net zero commitment and started to translate the agreements into policies and targets.
However, it can be challenging for nations, governments, and companies to accurately measure and benchmark their carbon emission reduction objectives.
Multiple regulations and proposals2 have been drafted simultaneously with separate legal texts, which in most cases are not aligned with one another especially on the accounting methodology.
GREEN WAREHOUSE MANAGEMENT To scale-up our decarbonisation efforts, we advocate for transparency and accountability across the value chain.
This starts from upstream material sourcing through to new, high-quality and innovative production.

BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 202367 Purchasing and Supplier Network OTHER INFORMATIONPRODUCTS AND SERVICESPRODUCTION AND OPERATIONDEALER AND SUPPL Y CHAINEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETY FUNDAMENTAL VISIONARY DIRECTION RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY IN THE SUPPL Y CHAIN The upstream automotive supply chain involves the procurement of raw materials and parts, including steel, non-ferrous metals, and HVBs.
A large share of automotive manufacturing s energy consumption and carbon emission comes from the production and processing of these materials.
In China, BMW is dedicated to developing, alongside our value chain partners to make a significant impact in improving energy efficiency and accelerating the energy transition.
Strong collaboration and partnership are needed within the supplier network to implement series of nationwide low- carbon initiatives.
For the existing supply chain energy structure and production technology, the adoption of renewable electricity is an effective and robust way to reduce carbon emissions in the supply chain.
BMW Group specifies 100 renewable electricity usage in future BMW product manufacturing as part of the direct-supplier (Tier 1) nomination requirements.
At the end of 2023, around 50 of supply chain electricity consumed by nominated local direct-supplier (Tier 1) for existing derivatives was committed to renewable sources.
Meanwhile, 100 of our aluminium ingot foundry shop suppliers have already made their switch to renewable electricity since 2021, and all of our HVB cells suppliers have adopted 100 renewable electricity in their self-production process.
We have developed digital training modules to enrich suppliers knowledge and level up management expertise of renewable electricity.
ENABLING CIRCULARITY IN THE SUPPL Y CHAIN We adhere to the Secondary First principle to reduce dependency on primary resources while ensuring product quality.
To this end, we are working to expand the different types and volumes of secondary materials in the supply chain.
We also piloted secondary plastic materials usage to produce brand-new interior and exterior parts for new vehicles.
Precious metals Achieved over 70 secondary raw material use of palladium and rhodium since 2022.
Aluminium ingot foundry Achieved 50 secondary raw material use as of the end of 2023.

CIRCULAR ECONOMY AWARD Yanfeng Plastic Omnium (Shenyang) Automotive Exterior Systems Co. Yanfeng is contributing to the industrial chain of recycled materials and supporting the sustainability efforts of BMW Group China.
Yanfeng rigorously sorts recycled materials by examining their density, colour, and near-infrared tests.
It is estimated that the use of the recycled materials developed by Yanfeng could reduce carbon emissions by 20 to 50, compared to primary materials.
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFORMATION & PARTNERSHIP IN THE SUPPL Y CHAIN Collaboration is the only way to achieve supply chain decarbonisation.
By enabling renewable electricity in electrolytic aluminium production and using recycled aluminium material, we can reduce carbon emissions by 14 tonnes and 18 tonnes carbon reduction per tonne of aluminium produced respectively, compared to traditionally sourced aluminium raw materials.
We also launched two Supply Chain Sustainability Awards the CO 2 Management Award and the Circular Economy Award to recognise outstanding initiatives and encourage supplier excellence.
The event reinforced communication and united BMW Group China with its suppliers amidst shared challenges.
The BMW Group integrates environmental, social standards and governance factors into its corporate sustainability strategy.
With this strategy, BMW Group China has implemented socially responsible supply chain practices, whilst complying with local regulations.
The sustainability targets of environment, health and safety (EHS) and social responsibility have been achieved through diverse projects, including third- party evaluation of sustainability questionnaires and regular assessments.
At the same time, we have enhanced supply chain transparency within the purchasing process with due diligence action.
In 2023, BMW Group China updated our Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) with enhanced requirements for responsible business practices, the use of critical raw materials, and environmental and social responsibilities.
SUPPLIER ENVIRONMENTAL, HEAL TH AND SAFETY RISK MANAGEMENT BMW Group China believes that robust supplier EHS management and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practices are the foundation of a sustainable supply chain.
Over the years, BMW Group China has cooperated extensively with suppliers to improve EHS performance and explore more efficient management approaches through BMW s Supplier EHS Management Programme.
We have formulated our Supplier Code of Conduct for raw material supply chains in accordance with environmental and social standards.
On top of that, we also oblige Tier 1 suppliers to pass these requirements on to their upstream sub-suppliers.
BMW Group focuses, in particular, on the conflict minerals tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (also known as 3TG).
Utilising standardised tools from the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), BMW Group is able to trace these raw materials back to the smelter.
In 2023, we conducted onsite assessments at 38 suppliers and raised average performance levels from 88 to 94.
We are enabling sustainability management by using a digitalised ESG Risk Management System (ERMS) to monitor suppliers sustainability performance.
The supply chain risks can be identified and tracked precisely by its risk tracking functions.
In 2023, more than 400 risk cases in our supply chain were identified and mitigated without causing any disruptions to our supply chain operations.
ENHANCE SUPPLY CHAIN ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY WITH ACTIONS To reduce EHS risks and secure the supply of BMW parts, we require our Tier 1 suppliers to conduct assessments of their upstream sub-suppliers.
These assessments are then jointly verified by BMW and the Tier 1 suppliers.
By the end of 2023, we have cumulatively completed 100 such Challenge Rounds through both remote and onsite assessment.
SUPPLIER TRAINING BMW Group China strives for continuous improvement in enhancing supply chain sustainability by continually raising our suppliers awareness and knowledge of BMW s sustainability standards and requirements.

The previous years' figures have been adjusted for comparison purposes.
The methodology used to calculate emissions changed in the 2023 reporting year.
Enhancements to the IT system have made it possible to perform a differentiated calculation for all vehicles taking into account different energy mixes and carbon emission factors for different production regions.
The values in the time series were adapted using this new methodology (values based on prior methodology for BMW Brilliance 2019 3, 981, 487 tCO2e, 2020 4, 339, 177 tCO2e, 2021 5, 071, 706 tCO2e, 2022 5, 179, 693 tCO2e, 2023 5, 666, 641 tCO2e; for BMW Group China 2022 6, 410, 297 tCO2e, 2023 6, 658, 211 tCO2e).
Emissions of the vehicle-related purchased goods and services and disposal are calculated based on life cycle assessment as per ISO 14040 44 of representative vehicles from the product lines using the LCA for Experts tool provided by Sphera.
The increase in this figure is mainly due to the adjustments to emissions factors and the increase in weight transported.
The increase in this figure is mainly due to the increase of the total number of automobiles produced and imported by BMW Group China in Chinese mainland market.
