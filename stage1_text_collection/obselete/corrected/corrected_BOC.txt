We adhered to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, highlighted the political significance and people-oriented nature of financial work, earnestly fulfilled our economic and social responsibilities as a major bank, built a diversified and professional system of financial products and services and went all out to support high-quality economic and social development. We stayed committed to our fundamental mission, optimized financial supply and did a better job in serving the real economy. Our RMB loans increased by about RMB2.4 trillion, strongly supporting the recovery of the real economy. In a bid to boost the development of new quality productive forces, the balance of loans in strategic emerging industries, manufacturing industry, and technology finance increased by 74.35%, 28.05%, and 30.94%, respectively. Focusing on the comprehensive financial needs of micro and small enterprises (MSEs), we expanded the coverage of more convenient financial services. The number of MSE customers and the balance of inclusive loans to them both grew by 43%, and continued to reduce fees and provide benefits to the inclusive customer groups. We supported the formation of a new model of real estate development, with rental housing loans up by 97.48%, and the interest rate lowered for stock personal housing loans totalling about RMB2.5 trillion, promoting the steady and healthy development of the real estate market. We put people first, enhanced service warmth, and continued to deepen finance that benefits the people. We continued to carry out the "job stabilization and expansion campaign" thematic activity and provided special loans to MSEs to help expand employment. Making efforts on both the supply and demand sides of the silver economy, we actively created new financial products, business forms, and models for elderly care, accelerating the establishment of a "finance +" pension service system. Our silver service scene served 9.26 million people, a year-on-year increase of 40.94%. We went all out to serve rural revitalization, and our agriculture-related loans increased by 28.53% to reach RMB 2,656,100 million, driving the effective connection between the achievements of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, and we extended our institution network to cover 26 more counties. We doubled down on assistance to the four counties of Yongshou, Changwu, Xunyi and Chunhua of Xianyang. In 2023, we implemented 101 assistance projects and spent non-reimbursable funds of RMB 80,570 thousand on them, continually enhancing the public's sense of gain and happiness. 02 Acting on the belief that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets, we supported green development, and served the construction of a beautiful China. Actively responding to climate change, we continued to internalize the green and lowcarbon development philosophy in all processes and aspects of business development, and worked with all sectors of society to create a high-quality ecological environment. We reviewed the Group's green finance indicator system for the 14th Five-Year Plan period, revised the green finance work plan, and clarified our development goals and work measures. In 2023, the actual new green loan amounted to RMB1.1195 billion, an increase of 56.34% from the beginning of the year. We continued to lead the market in the scale of green bond underwriting. Aimed at the goal of becoming "the preferred bank for green financial services", we upgraded and improved the "BOC Green+" product and service portfolio and enhanced the ESG risk management level of customers. We actively performed our duties in over 10 domestic and foreign green mechanisms, including the United Nations Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) and Green Investment Principles for the Belt and Road Initiative (GIP), and promoted international cooperation for green development. We leveraged our global advantages to serve high-level opening up and support the formation of a new development pattern that would feature positive interplay between domestic and international economic circulations. Making full use of our institutional network covering 64 overseas countries and regions, we served "going global" enterprises and "bringing in" enterprises and helped to stabilize foreign trade and foreign investment. We provided high-quality services for the China-Central Asia Summit and thoroughly participated in the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, making our contributions to global sustainable development. Phnom Penh Branch and BOC (Serbia) were approved to operate as RMB clearing banks by local authorities, and the cross-border RMB clearing volume of the Group increased by 26.55% year-on-year. We delivered more convenient cross-border RMB use, and saw the volume of cross-border RMB settlement business rise by more than 80% year-on-year and the number of Cross-boundary Wealth Management clients increasing by 62.71%, better meeting the financial service needs of cross-border trade and investment. We strengthened our bottom-line thinking, solidified our risk defences, and continuously improved our robust operational capabilities. We enhanced comprehensive risk management, improved risk assessment, investigation and emergency response mechanisms, and strengthened the management and control of non-traditional risks, continuously increasing our risk resilience and firmly safeguarding against systemic financial risks. We promoted the alignment of risk management with market conditions and business strategies, facilitating a dynamic balance and mutual reinforcement between development and security. We strengthened risk management and control in key areas such as real estate, local government debt, and small and medium-sized financial institutions, and stepped up efforts in collection and risk mitigation. We reinforced overseas risk management and control, effectively responding to fluctuations in the international financial market, and ensuring the safety of our overseas assets. We continuously improved the Group's work safety system, conducted hidden danger investigations, and strived to ensure complete safety. We consolidated the foundation of management, improved corporate governance, and continued to strengthen the momentum of sustainable development. The ESG philosophy is deeply embedded into our corporate governance. The Board of Directors regularly reviewed issues concerning consumer rights protection and green finance. We improved the effectiveness of corporate governance and stepped up in the daily communication of the Shareholders' General Meeting, the Board of Directors, the Board of Supervisors, and the management. We made timely and comprehensive information disclosures to the public and received the highest rating from the Shanghai Stock Exchange for ten consecutive years for our information disclosure work. To build a strong talent force, we improved mechanisms for talent cultivation, recruitment, and utilization. We also promote talent exchanges between the Head Office and branches, between domestic and foreign institutions, and between departments, and broaden the career development channels for employees. We took solid steps to promote the development of digital finance, promoted the deep integration of business and technology, accelerated digital and intelligent transformation, and focused on making our financial services more convenient and competitive. This year marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and a crucial moment for achieving the goals and tasks outlined in the 14th Five-Year Plan. Bank of China will unswervingly apply the new development philosophy, and find out how to strike an optimal balance between serving macro economic and social development and driving our high-quality corporate development, where to start and what points of support we can leverage. We will take the initiative to fulfil our mission and responsibility as a large bank, and actively serve the sustainable development of the economy, society and environment. We will contribute more to building a great country and rejuvenating the nation. Chairman 03 Message from the President In 2023, Bank of China fully and faithfully applied the new development philosophy on all fronts, adhered to a people-centred value orientation, carried on our century-old fine tradition, took the initiative to seize market opportunities, actively responded to various challenges, and continuously enhanced the adaptability, competitiveness, and inclusiveness of its financial services, so as to continuously improve the quality of its development in the course of fully serving the sustainable development of the economy, environment and society. We fulfilled our responsibility as a major bank and helped drive economic recovery and improvement. We continuously optimized financial supply, channeling more resources into major strategies, key areas, and weak links. We provided comprehensive financial services to over 15,000 national and provincial-level "specialized, refined, unique, and innovative" enterprises, better meeting the full life-cycle needs of technology companies. Lending growth in the private and small and micro sectors exceeded the Bank's overall average, and corporate integrated financing costs declined. We extended our reach in pension services, supported the accelerated development of the elderly care industry, enriched elderly care service scenarios, and deepened the age-friendliness of various financial service channels. With the goal of "high standards, sustainability, and benefiting livelihoods", we cumulatively followed up on over 1,000 credit projects in countries jointly building the Belt and Road Initiative, cumulatively providing over USD 316 billion in credit support. It served investment promotion and exhibition activities at national-level events such as the China International Import Expo and China International Consumer Products Expo, interfacing and serving over 100 local overseas investment promotion delegations. Throughout the year, we held 19 crossborder business matchmaking activities, in which nearly 3,000 domestic and foreign enterprises reached the intent of cooperation, involving more than USD20 billion. We optimised the service plan for protecting micro, small and medium-sized enterprises from exchange rate risks, and helping them better cope with market risks. We worked toward China's carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals and promoted green and low-carbon development. We have incorporated climate and environmental factors into the comprehensive risk management system, and added the requirements for green development to over 90 industryspecific credit policies. The Group's green financial service system 04 was perfected, and has fully covered such areas as loans, deposits, investment, debt, stocks, leasing, insurance, and carbon markets. The incentive and restraint mechanisms were improved, too. We moved faster to build use into a "preferred bank for green financial services", and contribute to ecological conservation. We enriched the scenario-based financial service system, upgraded and iterated online products, and vigorously supported green and low-carbon consumption. Green operations were advancing solidly. 310 more outlets were designated on a cumulative basis as specialty outlets in green finance. We are moving orderly towards the goal of a carbonneutral operation. In 2023, we received more than 10 awards from authoritative organizations at home and abroad, including the "Best ESG Bank in China", "Best Sustainable Finance Bank in China" and "Exemplary Units for Green Banking", and our brand influence in the field of green development continued to increase. We enhanced service quality and effectiveness and went all out to provide livelihood financial security. Focusing on education, healthcare, employment, childcare, elderly care, housing, urban renewal and other fields, we coordinated efforts in product innovation, process optimisation and scenario integration. We continued to improve the customer experience, expanded the "finance + government affairs" service scenarios at smart counters to over 1,100 scenarios, optimised services for groups with special needs, and provided customers with warmer finance service.

We fulfilled our social responsibilities and actively participated in charitable activities. To facilitate rural revitalization, we helped poor people build the confidence and capacity to help themselves. We offered 32 thousand training opportunities to primary-level government officials, role models in rural revitalization, and technical personnel. We established bases for the convenience of the public, with nearly nine thousand BOC Sharing Stations opened, covering all provinces in China. To promote people-topeople exchanges between China and the rest of the world, BOC, as the "financial envoy", supported a number of landmark projects such as the concert to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Philadelphia Orchestra's inaugural visit to China. We also reformed the financial model of philanthropy, built a BOC philanthropy platform, promoted charitable fundraising projects, and raised nearly RMB25 million in 2023. We co-launched the "BOC Private Enjoyment Love - Spring Bud" project with the China Children and Teenagers' Fund for 10 consecutive years and immediately raised funds and materials for disaster-stricken areas such as Gansu and Hebei. We assisted clients in setting up over 50 charitable trusts in the fields of rural revitalization, education, medical care, and art. In 2024, BOC will unswervingly adhere to the path of financial development with Chinese characteristics, strike an even better balance between functionality and profitability, vigorously promote the financial culture with Chinese characteristics, forge ahead with shareholders and employees, seek common development with customers and partners, and write a new chapter in the highquality corporate development on the grand blueprint of Chinese modernization.

Bank of China embodies a noble sense of commitment and responsibility. Since its establishment 112 years ago, the Bank has steadfastly upheld its historic mission of "promoting social welfare and contributing to a prosperous nation". This mission has formed a valuable spiritual legacy that aligns with the financial culture with Chinese characteristics: to remain committed to honesty and trustworthiness, to seek interest without compromising moral principles, to be prudent and cautious in work, to uphold fundamental principles and break new ground, and to be compliant with law and regulations. On the new journey towards building a modern socialist country in all respects, Bank of China will adhere to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and faithfully implement the new development philosophy.

Professional teams developed green finance across the Group with concrete efforts and put it in place properly. 13 Strategies and Policies The Bank has fully integrated the concept of sustainable development into its own development strategies, and contributed positively to the achievement of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals. Strategic goals BOC has set out the basic principles, strategic goals, and incentives for the development of green finance in the 14th Five-Year Plan for Green Finance of Bank of China Limited . In 2023, the Bank actively implemented the core requirements put forth at the Central Financial Work Conference and, re-examined the Group's 14th Five-Year Plan and the Action Plan for Green Finance, and formulated more aggressive green finance targets in light of market conditions and business developments, including "implementing the green and low-carbon concept to become the preferred bank for green financial services", "achieving leapfrog development of green finance business", "managing environmental and social risks properly", "exploring and progressively reducing carbon footprints of group operations and asset portfolios". Practice by BOC The Bank's green finance has developed rapidly and gained market recognition. In 2023, it won more than ten international and domestic authoritative awards in the field of green sustainability. Green credit: The target of new credit support for green industries during the 14th Five-Year Plan period was raised from "at least RMB1 trillion" to "at least RMB3 trillion". As at the end of 2023, the balance of green credit extended by the Bank domestically amounted to RMB3,106.7 billion, an increase of 56.34% from the end of the previous year. Green bonds: The target of "scaling up investment in green bonds year by year and leading the market in the underwriting of green bonds" was proposed. Investment of BOC in green bonds exceeded RMB100 billion as at the end of 2023. The Bank ranked first in the interbank market by green bonds underwritten both domestically and overseas, and took the first place among Chinese institutions in Bloomberg's global offshore green bond rankings. Therefore, it became the most active Chinese sustainability bond issuer. Customer ESG risks: The current management policy on ESG risks associated with customers of the Bank is applicable to corporate banking (including corporate working capital loans and project financing), and runs through the business processes such as risk identification and classification, due diligence, business approval, contract management, fund appropriation, post-lending management, and post-investment management. Green operations: Based on local policy requirements and actual condition, the Bank continuously improved and refined its energy and resource management system, vigorously promoted green and low-carbon production and lifestyle, actively applied energysaving technologies and utilized green power, and persistently controlled and reduced the total consumption and intensity of various energy resources, taking practical actions to support the implementation of the dual carbon goal. Asset portfolios: The Bank explored and researched a methodological system suitable for the carbon accounting of its asset portfolios and finished a trial calculation of carbon footprints for asset portfolios in carbon-intensive industries. On the premise of ensuring energy security and industrial chain/supply chain stability, it kept reducing the carbon intensity of asset portfolios in a progressive way until they finally became carbon neutral, as a response to the dual carbon goal of the state. 14 Environmental (climate-related) policies An overall set of policies With the aim to achieve the dual carbon goal of the state, BOC took the 14th Five-Year Plan for Green Finance as the strategic guide to continuously improve the "1+1+N" green finance policy system.

They were formulated as per the Guiding Opinions of the State Council on Addressing the Problem of Severe Overcapacity, the Specifications for Iron and Steel Industry (Revision in 2015) of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), theImplementation Measures for Capacity Replacement in the Iron and Steel Industry , and other policy documents of national ministries and commissions. Support shall be focused on projects in line with capacity replacement, energy consumption reduction, process optimisation, intelligent transformation, green transformation, and ultralow emissions. It is required to gradually withdraw from projects with backward technology and equipment, unqualified products, substandard energy consumption and emissions, and backward production capacity. Biodiversity BOC pays close attention to the impact that its customers cause on the ecosystem in their business activities, strictly complies with the laws, regulations, and rules on the protection of biodiversity, and prohibits the provision of credit support for acts that seriously damage biodiversity. For controversial projects, after making sure their compliance with the laws and regulations in the countries/regions where they are located, the Bank will extensively solicit the suggestions of professional assessment agencies, residents, media, and non-profit environmental protection organisations, among other stakeholders, prudently assess the environmental and social risks and nail down credit strategies, and urge related enterprises to establish ecological protection compensation mechanisms and consciously undertake ecological protection and restoration obligations. BOC incorporates clear biodiversity protection requirements into the credit policies of key industries such as wind power generation, pumped storage, and coal, as part of its efforts to safeguard the boundary of natural ecological protection as well as the national ecological safety. For the enterprises (projects) that are found to go against national policies and regulatory requirements, fail to meet environmental protection standards, and have significant environmental and climate risks; destroy critical habitats, important biodiversity areas and national nature reserves; illegally log, fish, and poach wildlife; blindly expand oil palm plantations leading to deforestation; and illegally occupy and destroy forest lands, the Bank requires not providing credit or investment support for these corporate customers; as to the existing business relations, it shall urge related customers to make rectifications and take effective measures to mitigate risks; and if rectifications are impossible, it shall exit from the projects with such customers as soon as possible. As a co-publisher of theCommon Action Plan for Banking Sector to Support Biodiversity Conservation , the Bank shall continuously step up the financial support for biodiversity undertakings. To ensure the binding nature of the credit policies for key industries or fields, the Bank shall specify customers' ESG risk management requirements in related contracts, set rigid limits for the industries with overcapacity such as iron and steel and cement, carry out list-based management, and strengthen authorisation management. Meanwhile, it shall strictly examine project documents of projects in the industries featuring "heavy pollution, high energy consumption, and overcapacity" with respect to approval and filing, environmental assessment, and energy-saving review, among other aspects and refrain from providing credit support to projects that do not meet the requirements for controlling the intensity and total volume of energy consumption, projects that are constructed prior to approval, or projects without any energy consumption quota or environmental capacity. 19 Managing ESG Risks Associated with Customers As global climate change intensifies, the prevention of non-traditional financial risks, such as ESG risks, has become a key issue of concern for banking financial institutions. BOC proactively identifies climate-related risks and opportunities, and made every effort to build a new system of green finance and makes the management of ESG risks associated with customers a key task in serving the dual carbon goal and implementing and developing green finance, so as to better manage such risks. Climate-related risks and opportunities Climate-related risks Taking for reference the definition and classification of climate risks by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), the Bank, from the perspectives of physical risk and transition risk, identified and analysed the short-term, medium-term, and long-term impacts of climate risk on its credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputational risk, country risk, and other major risks. Risk Type Examples of environmental (climate) risks Impact Timeframe Credit risk Physical risks: Extreme weather events damaging assets held by the Bank's clients, leading to the destruction or devaluation of collateral, or affecting supply chains, thereby impacting clients' operations, profitability, and survival, resulting in increased default rates. Transition risks: Carbon reduction policies affecting the profitability of carbon-intensive corporate clients, with related assets potentially becoming stranded. Medium to long-term Market risk Physical risks: Extreme weather events may damage national infrastructure, weaken economic growth and employment, lead to credit rating downgrades, thereby impacting the value of assets held on the Bank's balance sheet. Transition risks: "Carbon peaking" and "carbon neutrality" goal will trigger a shift in investor preferences, reducing expected returns of carbon-intensive assets, posing risks of valuation decline and increased investor volatility for the Bank. Short-term to medium to long-term. Short-term and medium to long-term 20 Risk Type Examples of environmental (climate) risks Impact Timeframe Liquidity risk Physical risks: Extreme weather events may cause extensive damage to physical properties, resulting in substantial construction and repair costs, leading to a surge in customer fund withdrawals and demand for emergency loans, exacerbating the Bank's liquidity pressures. Transition risks: With increasing environmental awareness, depositors and investors will strengthen their support for green finance businesses, affecting the funding sources of other financial businesses. Medium to long-term Operational risk Physical risks: Extreme weather events negatively impacting the Bank's infrastructure, systems, processes, and staff, disrupting business continuity. Transition risks: Inadequate internal procedures and systems to address climate change can lead to losses. Medium-term Reputation risk Physical risks: Providing financial support to clients and projects that harm habitats and biodiversity may expose the Bank to reputation risks. Transition risks: Continuously financing "high-pollution, high-energy consumption, high-emission" enterprises or significantly increasing holdings of carbon-intensive assets may result in reputation risks for the Bank. Short-term to medium to long-term Country risk Physical risks: Rising sea levels causing adverse effects on coastal countries' infrastructure and economy. Transition risks: Countries relying on traditional high-carbon development models will face impacts and challenges in transitioning to green and low-carbon development models. Medium to long-term Information Technology Risk Physical risks: Extreme weather events negatively affecting the Bank's equipment and systems, potentially causing system failures, data loss, or damage, resulting in financial or reputational losses. Transition risks: Significant changes in customer business operations due to the lowcarbon transition may render the Bank's existing information technology inadequate to meet new demands, resulting in financial losses. Short-term to medium to long-term 21 At this stage, banking financial institutions face significant transition risk. While the Chinese economy and society go green, related enterprises in traditional industries will see their financial position change to different degrees. In the process, their solvency will be impacted. There may be a rise in the default rate, which will in turn impact the asset quality of banks. Climate-related opportunities At a time when the world is active in addressing climate change and China has announced the dual carbon goal, the ongoing industrial restructuring and upgrading drive has presented both challenges and opportunities for the banking industry. A growing climate conducive to green finance worldwide Green finance has become a common discourse worldwide. The exchange and cooperation in green finance have become key drivers for the global development of the Group. Considerable policy dividends for green finance in China From the central to local governments, multi-level and diversified green finance policy systems promote the vigorous development of green finance business in commercial banks. Huge development potential in green industries Abundant opportunities in the field of carbon finance The green industries are presented with new opportunities, triggering a wave of green upgrades in traditional industries. China's carbon emission trading market is poised to expand under the "zero-carbon vision." Deep involvement of banks in the carbon finance field can effectively promote revenue growth. The regime of managing ESG risks associated with customers The Bank has established a customer ESG risk governance architecture that is appropriate to its business scale and attributes, and defined ESG risk management responsibilities within the architecture. Board of Directors Assuming the ultimate responsibility for the comprehensive risk management, including the management of ESG risks associated with customers. Senior Management Assuming the implementation responsibility for the management of ESG risks associated with customers and executing the resolutions of the Board of Directors. The Chief Risk Officer acts as the Chair of the Green Finance Committee, and is responsible for managing ESG risks associated with customers. Independent from operation and business lines, the Chief Risk Officer can directly report to the Board of Directors updates about comprehensive risk management. Professional teams Business departments (the first line of defence) They are responsible for implementing the policies and processes related to the management of ESG risks associated with customers. They shall accurately categorise, identify, measure, assess, monitor, control, and properly manage and address ESG risks associated with customers, and adequately identify and assess ESG risks associated with new products or businesses. Risk management departments (the second line of defence) They are responsible for developing ESG risk management policies and processes. They shall provide guidance for, give training to, monitor, and inspect the work done by the first line of defence, while transmitting ESG risk appetite effectively. Audit departments (the third line of defence) They are responsible for organising and conducting internal audits of green finance on a regular basis. 22 23 In 2023, the Bank revised the Comprehensive Risk Management Policy of the Bank of China Limited, updating "environmental and social risks" as "environmental (climate), social, and governance risks", and including Customer ESG risks in its comprehensive risk management regime. The qualitative statement about ESG risk appetite was also updated in the risk appetite statement Customer ESG risks. TheManagement Policy on Environmental (Climate), Social, and Governance Risks Associated with Customers of Bank of China is currently adopted at the Bank. It was formulated according to regulatory requirements and the Group's 14th five-year plan for green finance, and with reference to the guidelines regarding climate-related financial risk management and sustainability performance standards, including those released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, International Finance Corporation, and the Equator Principles. Approved by the Green Finance Committee, the policy is applicable to corporate banking (including corporate working capital loans and project financing) and investment, and runs through the business processes such as risk identification and classification, due diligence, business approval, contract management, fund appropriation, post-lending management, and post-investment management. Besides, the Bank has included requirements related to environment protection in due diligence on investment banking business. The Bank has included binding requirements for environmental and social risk management in more than 90 industry credit policies, which involve agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery, mining and metallurgy, oil, gas and chemical engineering, construction and real estate, and transportation and logistics. It has also specified requirements for biodiversity conservation in credit policies for key industries like wind power generation, pumped-storage hydropower, and coal. 24 The whole-process management of ESG risks associated with customers The Bank has established a whole-process management approach that could cover risk identification, measurement, assessment, monitoring and reporting, and control and mitigation to control and reduce ESG risks associated with customers. Risk identification BOC categorises customers into three categories, that is, A, B and C, given many factors such as their potential environmental (climate) and social risks, industries to which they belong, and their stage of development, labels them in related business management systems, and takes more stringent assessment and review measures for high-risk customers. The categorisation results are re-examined periodically. In case of unexpected events that cause changes to the categorisation results, updates are made to the relevant systems in a timely manner. Risk measurement The Bank conducted bank-wise stress testing under the macro scenarios of climate risk. The stress tests were designed to examine the impact of various factors including temperature rise and carbon emission prices, on the change in credit risk associated with corporate loans across the Bank. Conducting climate risk stress tests to analyse and manage climate risk in a science-based manner In 2023, overseas branches/institutions of the Bank did work related to climate risk stress testing. They analysed the impact of physical risk caused by extreme climate conditions such as floods, typhoons, and sea level rise on key industries, with testing results indicating that relevant risks were manageable overall. BOCHK In accordance with the latest requirements of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in the Guidelines for Banking Sector Climate Risk Stress Test in 2023, it optimized the climate risk stress testing method and finished the "short-term scenario" climate risk stress testing as per regulatory requirements to assess financial impact of transition risk and physical risk on the banks.. BOC (UK) It actively advanced work related to climate risk stress testing to assess potential financial impacts of transition risk and physical risk under stress scenarios. Singapore Branch and Paris Branch They completed the climate risk stress test for the electricity industry. Based on the global stress scenarios provided by the NGFS, they devised transmission paths for transition risk and physical risk, and comprehensively assessed the impact of climate risk on the business and credit risk of the electricity industry in terms of regulatory policies and regulations, movements of carbon price, changes in market demand, changes in the cost of major raw materials, technological replacement, and losses due to climate disasters, among other aspects. The Bank explored and researched the methodological system suitable for the carbon accounting of its asset portfolios, and finished the pilot calculation of carbon footprints of the asset portfolios in carbon-intensive industries. Taking reference to the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry released by Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) and theGuide on the Carbon Accounting Technology for Financial Institutions (Provisional) released by the PBOC, the Bank conducted trial accounting of carbon emissions from the corporate loans in three major carbon-intensive industries, including thermal power generation, iron & steel, and building materials. 25 Due diligence and risk assessment Due diligence Credit business The Bank required the customer relations departments to carry out due diligence on the ESG risks of customers (projects), make clear the key elements of due diligence based on the characteristics of the industries and regions where the customers or projects were located, analyse and assess relevant risks in business launch reports and related business management systems, and carry out compliance risk reviews. For the customers (projects) that may have potential and significant impact on social stability and public interests, such as nuclear power projects, waste incineration projects in densely populated areas, and large hydroelectric projects, the Bank required the customer relations departments to fully evaluate relevant risks, and promptly withdraw from the customers (projects) if no due diligence had been conducted on their Customer ESG risks. Bond underwriting business The Bank required customers (projects) to be strictly reviewed for Customer ESG risks in the processes of customer or project selection, business access, etc. For the carbon-intensive industries, such as coal and thermal power generation, the Bank made ESG risk-related factors, including environmental protection improvement and governance efforts, environmental impact reports, and energy conservation evaluation reports of customers, an important part of due diligence at the stage of business access. 26 Risk assessment BOC manages and assesses its ESG risks of customers and their projects in a category-based manner from 13 dimensions given the characteristics of the industries and regions to which they belong. Key elements under mandatory inspection in the assessment of ESG risks associated with customers Assessment and management system of ESG risks associated with customers and their projects Specific assessment standards (1) whether a management system is in place to prevent ESG risks; (2) whether management personnel are in place to prevent environmental ESG risks; (3) whether there is a strong awareness of preventing ESG risks; etc. Labour and working conditions (1) whether workers are treated fairly and provided with equal opportunities; (2) whether workers are provided with a safe and healthy work environment or appropriate safeguards; (3) whether employment and labour laws of the countries where projects are located are complied with; (4) whether there is a grievance mechanism for workers (and their organisations, where they exist) to raise workplace concerns; etc. Pollution prevention and control (1) whether customers/projects have committed environmental violations and whether they have been rectified and passed acceptance examinations of the competent management authorities; (2) whether customers/projects avoid the release of pollutants or, when avoidance is not feasible, minimise or control the intensity and mass flow of their release; (3) whether customers/projects avoid the generation of hazardous or non-hazardous waste materials or, when wastage generation cannot be avoided, reduce the generation of waste, and recover and reuse in a way that is safe for human health and the environment (climate); etc. Biodiversity conservation and sustainable natural resource management (1) whether customers/projects, as a matter of priority, seek to avoid impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services; (2) when avoidance of impacts is not possible, whether customers/projects adopt measures to minimise impacts and restore biodiversity and ecosystem services; (3) given the complexity in predicting project impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services over the long term, whether customers/projects adopt a practice of adaptive management in which the implementation of mitigation and management measures are responsive to changing conditions and the results of monitoring throughout the project lifecycle. Carbon footprint management (1) whether customers/projects have formulated strategic plans or management policies concerning the green and low-carbon transition; (2) whether customers/projects carry out carbon emission accounting; (3) whether customers/projects intensify their energy and resource management to gradually reduce the carbon emissions in Scope 1 and Scope 2; (4) whether customers/projects pay enough attention to the carbon footprints of enterprises along supply chains to gradually reduce the carbon emissions in Scope 3. In addition, other key elements in the assessment of ESG risks associated with customers and their projects include community health and safety, land acquisition and involuntary relocation, respect for cultures and customs of indigenous peoples and ethnic, cultural heritage protection, explosives and chemicals management, ESG risk management among supply chain, organizational framework and operational management, and financial management and risk management. 27 Risk monitoring and reporting The Bank intensified monitoring of ESG risks associated with customers, issued internal risk prompts or early warnings for the customers (projects) located in the industries or regions identified by national environmental protection or work safety authorities as key ones for rectification of illegal practices, tracked and monitored relevant risk events throughout the process, and adjusted risk levels and disposal measures as appropriate based on actual conditions. The Bank continued to improve the customers' ESG risk emergency response measures and reporting mechanism, categorised sudden ESG risk events into four levels, i.e. average, big, significant, and particularly significant, and required institutions where the events took place to initiate the plan right after the events, address the events legally, scientifically, efficiently, and properly, and report the events in a timely, objective, true and compressive manner based on the principle of leveled response. ESG risks associated with customers were fully investigated, monitored, and reported in a timely manner. Risk control and mitigation The Bank took risk management moves including key business strategies, differentiated authorities and processes, and list-based management, to actively control and ease the customers' ESG risks. Key business strategies In credit strategies, the Bank defined risk levels including active support, prudent credit granting or investment, and no credit granting or investment based on the environmental protection ratings of customers, and linked environmental protection ratings with credit ratings. Circumstances in which the Bank will provide active support The Bank will actively channel resources into the green industries on theGuiding Catalogue for Green Industries, which engage in energy conservation and environmental protection, clean production, clean energy, ecological environment, green upgrading of infrastructures, and green services. It will actively serve the green and low-carbon implementation of the BRI. Circumstances in which the Bank will be cautious about providing credit or investment support Enterprises whose environmental credit rating has a colour code of yellow. Enterprises that are above the industry average in pollutant emissions or energy consumption and have no technological adaption plans. Enterprises that may have a significant adverse impact on the health or living environment of indigenous people and ethnic minorities, or that may trigger severe conflicts over resources or land and have not developed effective mitigation measures. Enterprises that seriously infringe on the rights of shareholders of small and medium enterprises and that are severely short of financial management and risk management mechanisms and have no plan to rectify the situation. Circumstances in which the Bank shall not provide credit or investment support Enterprises that fail to pass national environmental impact assessment, whose environmental protection credit rating is red or black, that are put on the "black list" for illegal environmental practices, that destroy key habitats, important biodiversity areas or national natural reserves, or that illegally log, fish, poach wildlife, cause deforestation through the excessive expansion of oil palm plantations, or illegally occupy and destroy forest lands. Existing businesses that involve any of the said circumstances shall be urged to rectify the problems and those that cannot rectify shall exit as soon as possible. 28 Differentiated authority and processes In line with the implementation of the green finance development strategy and the adherence to the green lending concept, the Bank strengthened environmental (climate) and social risk management and re-examined the differentiated credit authorization delegation schemes across BOC. For industries with high Customer ESG risks, such as iron & steel, cement, electrolytic aluminium, and coal chemical, it was further clearly stipulated that in compliance with certain conditions, credit applications shall be submitted to the Head Office for approval. For green industries in the active growth category to which more credit would be extended, authorisation delegation shall be expanded. List-based management The Bank exercised list-based management for customers involving higher Customer ESG risks, differentiating management of members on the list, and urging customers to take measures to alleviate Customer ESG risks, such as formulating and implementing risk response plans and smoothening the complaint channels for stakeholders. Digitising the management of ESG risks associated with customers The Bank continued to improve the intelligent management of green finance. Phase II of the green finance management system was put into operation, enabling intelligent categorisation of ESG risks associated with customers and export of customer lists, dynamically monitoring customers' environmental protection information like ratings and punishments, and supporting intelligent forewarning, regular evaluation, and whole-process control of ESG risks associated with customers. Developing a model specialising in environmental climate evaluation to strengthen climate risk prevention capabilities BOC Shanghai Branch developed a model specialising in environmental climate evaluation. Capable of measuring an enterprise's environmental friendliness, potential for low-carbon development, and resilience to climate change with 60 indicators, the model could assess the enterprise's risks in relation to environmental and climate performance and sustainability comprehensively and dynamically, in an effort to effectively empower all aspects of the credit management process. Environmental (Climate) Risk Evaluation Indicators Environmental profiling factors Climate carbon efficiency factors Green industries Pollution discharge/ security permit Green certification Pollution monitoring and governance Environmental input Environmental violation Green insurance Environmental credit ... Energy consumption intensity and efficiency Carbon emission intensity and efficiency Resource utilisation efficiency Optimisation of green asset structure Climate resilience factors Climate governance Climate risk: transition risk and physical risk Climate opportunities 29 The transition finance management system was created to follow the transition process conveniently BOC Zhejiang Branch explored the establishment of a transition finance management system to standardise the objectives, paths, progress, and information disclosure of entities in transition. The system could provide a centralised view of the geographical/industry distribution of carbon-intensive enterprises as a percentage of all enterprises in Zhejiang Province, as well as data of the performance of key customers in transition, such as the carbon efficiency level, carbon emission volume, and carbon emission intensity of enterprises, thus visualising the transition process of carbon-intensive enterprises. The system has two modules, namely, the transition tracking module and the enterprise tracking module. The transition tracking module is used to record the pilot transition finance projects, and the enterprise tracking module could automatically verify and disclose key performance indicators (KPIs) during the loan duration, such as transition progress, carbon emission data, and corporate governance information. The data in the system can be used to carry out post-lending management of customers and decide preferential terms and drawdown ratios in loan contracts considering the progress of enterprises in transition. 30 Indicators and Targets With becoming the "preferred bank of green financial services" as a goal, BOC improved its green finance products and services. While increasing its support for green industries such as clean energy and paying particular attention to the financial needs of traditional industries during their green transition and upgrading, the Bank continued to build the "BOC Green+" global brand by launching dozens of green finance products and services in five categories, covering deposit, loans, bonds, consumption, and integrated services, to actively support the green and low-carbon transition of the Chinese economy and society. Target during the 14th Fiveyear Plan period New credit support for green industries will be at least RMB3 trillion. The balance of credit finance will go up year by year. BOC will maintain sound asset quality. Status of completion in 2023 As at the end of 2023, the balance of green credit extended by the Bank domestically reached RMB3,106.7 billion, which included new credit of RMB1,119.5 billion and represented an increase of RMB2,209.9 billion from the end of the 13th Five-Year Plan period. Year-on-year growth of 56.34% Non-performing ratio of green credit remained below 0.5%, which was lower than the overall NPL ratio of the Group. Green bond investments will go up year by year. The Bank will lead the market by the green bond underwriting capacity. BOC will no longer provide financing for new coal mining and coal power projects outside of China from the fourth quarter of 2021 onwards, except for the projects already contracted. Investments in green bonds expanded in size continuously. Investment of BOC in green bonds exceeded RMB100 billion as at the end of 2023. The Bank ranked first in the interbank market by green bonds underwritten both domestically and overseas, and took the first place among Chinese institutions in Bloomberg's global offshore green bond rankings. There was no financing for new coal mining projects or new coal power projects overseas. 31 Green investment and financing "BOC Green+" financial product and service The Bank provides enterprises with green financing support Green+ loans Green+ inclusive finance Green+ trade finance Green+ bond investment Green fixed asset loans Green credit granted by rural banks Green factoring Front-end green project loans Green M&A loans Featured green and inclusive credit Green bond investment Green loans and sustainability-linked loans aligned with international codes Carbon emission quota pledge financing Green equity backed loans Renewable energy subsidy authentic right loans The Bank assists customers in managing green liquidity and green assets Green+ liquidity management Green+ asset management Green deposits Cash management of green enterprises ESG funds/green funds Green finance-themed wealth management products The Bank supports customers through integrated green financial services Green+ bond underwriting Green + stock underwriting Green+ equity investment Green+ leasing Green+ insurance Green+ carbon market Green+ consulting and analysis Green bond underwriting Green ABS Underwriting of stocks of green enterprises Green equity investment Green financial leasing Energy-efficient aircraft leasing Risk security insurance for Risk security insurance for Security insurance for green industries environmental pollution green transport Carbon market settlement/ Carbon transaction BOC E-commerce Connect deposit custody Green financial consulting Green index The Bank supports personal customers in leading a green and low- carbon life Green+ personal consumer credit Green+ personal business loans Personal green Credit-based personal installment Personal green themed housing loans loans for new energy vehicles credit card Personal green business loans The Bank actively responds to investors' demands for green development Green+ bond issuance Green+ custody Green+ capital market sales Issuance of green/blue bonds Issuance of sustainability-linked bonds Green custody Green capital market sales 32 "Green+" loans The Bank made efforts to support green industries and projects, gave priority to approving green, low-carbon, or eco-friendly customers, and promoted fast growth of green credit. As at the end of 2023, the balance of green credit extended by the Bank domestically was equivalent to RMB3,106.7 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of 56.34%. Serving as the exclusive lead arranger for the first sustainability-linked loan in China's shipping industry In 2023, BOC Shanghai Branch arranged a sustainability-linked syndicated loan worth RMB1.5 billion for COSCO Shipping Energy Transportation Company Limited (COSCO Shipping) as the first of its kind in China's shipping industry. Relying on the strategic plan of COSCO Shipping for sustainable development, the branch selected appropriate environmental and social KPIs, examined the progress the company had made toward its sustainable development targets in the past two years, and assisted the company in making energy transportation by ships a green and harmless process and in holding work safety management to high standards. Highlights of globalisation practices BOC, as a global co-lead bank, contracted a 1GW wind power project located in Bash and Zankeldi, Bukhara, Uzbekistan. It is the largest standalone wind power project in Central Asia and an important project planned by the Uzbek government for the benefit of the people. Upon completion, it could provide 3.5 billion kWh of electricity to the local power grid every year, reduce carbon emissions by 1.6 million tonnes, and create about 500 jobs in the local community. BOC Sydney Branch, as the sustainability coordinator, launched an innovative sustainability-linked loan that contained biodiversity conservation indicators to support the sustainable development of the Macquarie University campus in Australia. BOC Zhejiang Branch participates in the syndicated loan for the "Dongtou Bay Sea Garden for Common Wealth" ecology-oriented development (EOD) project, China's first comprehensive marine environment governance project, to support the environmental improvement in the near-shore sea areas and the ecological restoration in islands and surrounding waters. 33 "Green+" bonds The Bank developed the Sustainability Bond Management Statement (Version 2023) in accordance with the latest principles related to sustainability bonds published by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA). Meanwhile, it refined theTransition Bond Management Statement in accordance with the Common Ground Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance of the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF), theEuropean Union Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities, and the industry recognition standards of the Climate Bonds Initiative. Underwriting China's first non-financial enterprise debt financing instrument linked to local carbon market transactions As the sole lead underwriter, the Bank assisted Fujian Energy Group Co., Ltd. in issuing the second tranche of ultra-short-term financing bonds (carbon assets) in 2023, which is the first carbon asset bond linked to the local carbon market and the first carbon asset-based bond issued by an enterprise qualified for issuing debt financing instruments (DFIs) in China. Therefore, it is of great significance for the companies in Fujian to explore the use of financial instruments to move toward the dual carbon goal. Supporting an NEV manufacturer to issue green asset-backed securitisation products In February 2023, the Bank acted as the exclusive lead underwriter and bookrunner to help XCMG New Energy Vehicle Co., Ltd. in Xuzhou issue the first tranche of green, private asset-backed notes in 2023, with an issuance amount of RMB597 million and a term of three years. While assisting the issuer to make its debut in the debt capital market, the Bank landed the first green bond in the field of new energy commercial vehicles in China. The proceeds would be used to support the issuer in manufacturing new energy commercial vehicles, in an effort to facilitate energy conservation and emission reduction. Highlights of globalisation practices BOC Sydney Branch issued the world's first USD300 million sustainability-linked loan-backed bond and the first sustainability-linked loan-backed bond in the Asia-Pacific region with the independent second-party opinion from an international ESG assessment agency. "Green+" inclusive finance To promote the integrated development of green finance, inclusive finance, and technology finance, the Bank increased support for the green development of inclusive finance customer groups such as agricultural-related enterprises and small and micro manufacturing enterprises. By the end of 2023, the Bank's green and inclusive finance loan balance was RMB16.737 billion, registering a growth rate of 41.69% in the year. 34 "Green+" consumption The Bank innovated green finance products from the consumption side, guided or encouraged consumers to increase low-carbon behaviour and choose green products, and promoted the green and low-carbon transition of personal spending. Wealth management products on the theme of green finance As at the end of 2023, the Bank sold on an agency basis 49 green finance products such as "ESG Premium". The outstanding products had a size of RMB47,517 million. Mutual fund products on the theme of green finance As at the end of 2023, the Bank sold on an agency basis 50 green finance-themed mutual funds in aggregate, with an outstanding size of RMB10,081 million. These funds were invested in a wide range of green industries such as ecological conservation, lowcarbon transition, new energy, and new materials.

Please disclose the indicators used as well as the year of the baseline. You can build upon the performance measurement undertaken in 2.1 to determine the baseline for your target. A package of indicators has been developed for climate change mitigation and financial health & inclusion to guide and support banks in their target setting and implementation journey. The overview of indicators can be found in the Annex of this template.
