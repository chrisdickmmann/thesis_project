Mr. Sean Green President and CEO, BMW Group China 05 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 Dr. Franz Decker President and CEO, BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. VISIONARY DIRECTION FUNDAMENTAL Voice from Management PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PRODUCTION AND OPERATION DEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETY OTHER INFORMATION EMBARK TO THE FUTURE COLLABORATE TO GROW Over the past decades, BMW Brilliance has experienced significant growth alongside China's economy. As an integral part of the Chinese industrial ecosystem, BMW Brilliance has forged close collaboration with our partners, jointly creating opportunities and achieving mutual growth. Looking ahead, BMW Brilliance's development concept is aligned with China's innovation focus, the "New Quality Productive Forces," and incorporates digitalisation, electrification, and sustainability into our core business. We understand sustainability is a complex challenge that requires multidisciplinary solutions. Deeper collaboration is therefore critical. Through knowledge sharing, talent development, and technology we can break down barriers, spark innovation, and accelerate progress. BMW Brilliance will continue to contribute to society by bringing systematic change to the automotive sector in three aspects - decarbonisation, circularity, and stakeholder engagement. ACCELERATE DECARBONISATION. We have passed numerous milestones on China's journey to carbon neutrality, and we are wellprepared to play our role and help face this challenge. The BMW Group understands the level of transformation required to meet global climate goals and has taken an ambitious and science-based approach to setting our targets, which is reflected in joining the "Business Ambition for 1.5Â°C" pledge. Accelerating progress by raising standards that benefit the industry. We continued to encourage local suppliers to join us in building a circular and low carbon supply chain. BMW Group specifies 100% renewable electricity usage for future BMW product as part of the direct-supplier (Tier 1) nomination requirements. At the end of 2023, around 50% of the electricity consumed by local direct-suppliers (Tier 1) for existing derivatives was committed to renewable sources. By the end of 2023, these efforts have helped BMW Brilliance to reduce supply chain emissions by over 400,000 tCO2. 06 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 VISIONARY DIRECTION FUNDAMENTAL Voice from Management PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PRODUCTION AND OPERATION DEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETY OTHER INFORMATION Only with collaborations we can safeguard future generations. Through our retail initiatives, over 250 dealers were awarded the Network Transformation Green Star certificate after taking steps to build more sustainable operations, including reducing their energy consumption and switching to green power - ultimately using 1,530,000 MWh of renewable electricity. CIRCULARITY: DRIVING RESOURCE EFFICIENCY ACROSS THE VALUE CHAIN Circular economy redefines resources. To promote resource efficiency, we started with our own production process. Water, a finite resource, is not discharged, but kept in use, and since 2016, we have continued to expand reclaimed water usage in our production. In 2023, the total volume of recycled wastewater reached 159,325 mÂ³ across all plants, representing a 51.4% increase from last year. To turn waste into a reusable resource, through operational optimisation and cooperation with third-party facilities, the Powertrain Plant achieved zero landfill waste in January 2023. BMW Brilliance is collaborating with its partners to help make green supply chains a reality. By signing Memorandums of Understandings (MoU) for low carbon aluminium we support the use of renewable electricity in electrolytic aluminium production thereby reducing emissions by 14 tonnes per ton of aluminium produced. Furthermore by using recycled aluminium materials, we can reduce emissions by 18 tonnes per tonne of aluminium produced. Concurrently, all our retired high voltage batteries (HVBs) in China are recycled in a closed loop. During 2023, 1,041 tonnes of HVB raw materials were secured and re-processed into brand-new battery packs for 2,400 BMW i3 vehicles - meeting the same quality standard as every other BMW i3 battery pack. ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY INITIATIVES BMW Brilliance aims not only for business growth, but also for the mutual growth of people, cultures, and communities. We collaborate with various stakeholders, including business partners, industry associations, think tanks, and others, to drive innovation and mutually beneficial agendas that support China's sustainable development goals. We are dedicated to protecting local culture and biodiversity while providing solutions to society and communities through education and support for environmental and cultural causes. In 2023, there were 35,542,888 beneficiaries of our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities, increasing 11.47% from 2022. In April 2024, the BMW Group China, in collaboration with the Network of International Cultural Link Entities of Ministry of Culture & Tourism and the China Education Development Foundation, jointly launched the "BMW China Culture Journey - Grand Canal Cultural Protection and Education Public Welfare Programme." This initiative aims to extend our 18-years of experience helping to protecting China's intangible cultural heritage to the Grand Canal. Looking ahead, with an open mindset and practical action, we will play our role to shape a responsible and sustainable future together with our stakeholders, employees, and society as a whole. 07 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 VISIONARY DIRECTION FUNDAMENTAL Voice from Management PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PRODUCTION AND OPERATION DEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETY OTHER INFORMATION VOICES FROM MANAGEMENT Responsible and sustainable behaviour is one of our core values and is firmly anchored in BMW Group's corporate strategy. For the BMW, one thing is certain: we want to lead the way when it comes to sustainability. That's why it is critical that our Purchasing, Development and Production divisions work together on delivering on our commitments for carbon emissions reduction, the circular economy and environmental and social responsibility. To continue achieving the best results, we pursue well thought-out, effective and flexible solutions in product development, production and collaborations with our supplier network. Together, we will continue to focus on the best outcomes to enable 360-degree sustainability solutions. Ms. Nicole Guenther President, BMW China Services Ltd. A sustainable supply chain provides the foundation for a longterm business success. The sustainability activities of the BMW Group China start with our supplier network, which accounts for more than 60% of total value added, making a significant contribution to sustainability. Responsible, sustainable, and lawful behaviour is one of our core values and is firmly anchored in BMW Group China's supply chain. We commit to compliance with environmental and social standards, not only at our own company, but also in our supplier network. We continuously define clear and verifiable measures across the whole supply chain to contribute to our BMW Group carbon reduction targets. To ensure low carbon and circular concepts are integrated into the design and manufacture of the components, we closely collaborate with Research and Development (R&D) and Production as well as with suppliers to advance in three aspects - optimise material recyclability, increase the use of secondary raw material, and use low carbon material produced by renewable energy. Over the last several years, we have expanded our strategic collaborations with local suppliers to ensure the availability of low-carbon materials by signing Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) and establishing closed-loop recycling for different types of materials, including batteries, steel and aluminium. Dr. Robert Kahlenberg Senior Vice President, BMW Research & Development China R&D are the enabler for sustainability. Design and engineering are the fundamental stage to initiate sustainability concept. By integrating sustainability into product development, rather than treating it as an afterthought, we are reducing costs and time investment through efficient use of resources. From interiors to electromagnetic protection, we ensure no toxic substances inside the vehicles, and no harmful emissions from interior parts, while keeping low magnetic emissions. From product materials to energy efficiency, we aim to increase the material recyclability and secondary raw material usage, reduce energy consumption and carbon footprint. By redesigning components, from alloy-cast wheels made from continually increasing secondary aluminum, to innovative sustainable 3D textile that is completely plant-based, mineral based and petroleum-free for Vision Neue Klasse X concept, we keep pushing the limit to make luxury sustainable and inspiring. Mr. Robert Kuessel Senior Vice President, Technology and Manufacturing, BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. For automotive manufacturing sector, advanced technologies can promote resource and energy efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint of vehicles. Tailored to the unique dynamics of the Chinese market, our Shenyang manufacturing base harmonises expertise and resources across Research & Development, Purchasing, and Production functions. This approach not only redefines precision and flexibility, but also enables environmental stewardship. By consistently applying resource efficiency and circularity concepts, we can set clear and trackable targets for decarbonisation, energy, resource use, and waste reduction. This approach allows us to optimise energy use, material sourcing, logistics, and more. To further reduce carbon emissions, we tested a geothermal-well in 2023 to explore the use of renewable energy for heating at our Gen 6 Battery Powertrain Plant. In 2023, water consumption per vehicle produced was 1.72 mÂ­3Â­, 40% less compared to 2019. For logistics, we used sea freight throughout 2023 for inbound production supplies, and the total sea freight transportation volume increased by 10% compared with 2022. For packaging containers, we seek process optimisation and lean production throughout their lifecycle, and last year 50,719 plastic container parts were recycled. With every step we take, sustainability and responsibility are deeply embedded into every aspect of our operations. 08 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 VISIONARY DIRECTION FUNDAMENTAL Voice from Management PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PRODUCTION AND OPERATION DEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETY OTHER INFORMATION BMW Group China strives to provide the industry's best customer experience.

Many of the changes observed in the climate permeating almost all aspect of our lives - such as continued sea level rise, forest loss, ocean acidification, spread of vector-borne diseases and heightened food insecurity (IPCC, 2022). However, strong and sustained reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases would limit climate change. Understanding the basics of climate science is key to take actions to mitigate its worst impacts. As science and regulation evolves, so too must our responses to it. Enhance transparency and accountability can directly help society to analyse climate change developments and swiftly embark on the journey of decarbonisation. External environment & challenges Following the global consensus of Paris Agreement, numerous countries and governments, investors, and companies are increasingly adopting net zero commitment and started to translate the agreements into policies and targets. However, it can be challenging for nations, governments, and companies to accurately measure and benchmark their carbon emission reduction objectives. Multiple regulations and proposals2 have been drafted simultaneously with separate legal texts, which in most cases are not aligned with one another especially on the accounting methodology. 1. IPCC. (2021). Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis. https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/ 2. Corporate Disclosure (CSRD), Battery Regulation (Battery PCF) and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) etc. 3. Such as (vertical) competition laws 4. Greenhouse Gas Protocol. (2016).

Energy Transition Investment Trends 2024. https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/ sites/24/Energy-Transition-Investment-Trends-2024.pdf Lack of accounting standardisation. The reporting and verification for the data along the value chain remains challenging in the past as most of the reporting was voluntary and certain regulations3 might pose difficulties for firms to seek detailed information from an n-Tier supply chain. This could potentially result in data in-transparency, overburdening and restricting competitive international social and economic development. One element of the solutions is to standardise an internationally harmonised carbon accounting and reduction approach. Under such framework conditions, the GHG Protocol4 standard rightly allows companies to supplement measured data or supplier-specific data with industry-average data from independent data providers. Lack of primary data. While this enables guesstimates which provides a good start, due to the lack of internationally recognised accounting method, the use of secondary data and industry average data oftentimes lead to high variability of results of same products and inaccurate accounting of supply chain decarbonisation effort. Reckoning with the China government's leadership position on R.E. with greater effort to address environmental issues. In 2024, China remains with the highest levels of investment in the low-carbon energy transition5. The continued reliance on regional or data providers' default-average values could pose challenges to reflect and make mitigation deductions measurements accountable. This can deprive companies' key lever to pursue a specific decarbonisation strategy across its value chain. BMW GROUP POSITION: STANDARDISED CARBON ACCOUNTING & RELIABLE PRIMARY DATA & DIGITALISATION We support the creation of a methodological framework that clearly focuses on the measured benefits for the climate, that relies on an internationally accepted standards and enables the compatibility of internal management and external reporting logic. We support the standardisation of CO2 calculation and auditing methods but not the values themselves and support their exchange of CO2 related data along the value chain. Such framework needs to allow the firm to report emissions unique to its supply chain taking into account the mitigation results achieved by the firm and its suppliers. This leaves the incentives in the system for firms to deploy their market power and initiatives for emission reductions, which would also get reflected in product and emissions reporting against mandatory requirements (regulations) or voluntary reporting (reputation). We support Data digitalisation including internationally agreed data platform and initiative. As a uniform data rulebook and database is crucial step to provide a cooperative environment where transparent, reliable, and complete CO2 data can be exchanged and respectively be measured and reported across the entire value chain. BMW Group supports and drives forward pursuing primary data instead of secondary and average emission factor for product carbon footprint calculation at corporate level. Hence BMW Group China fully support local suppliers' efforts on decarbonisation such as using green power and secondary material can be more accurately tracked and recognised. In turn, sustainability action takers can fully engage the effort to contribute the part on the journey of decarbonisation. 12 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 VISIONARY DIRECTION Featured Topic #1 FUNDAMENTAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PRODUCTION AND OPERATION DEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETY OTHER INFORMATION Featured topic #1 Part 2 ACTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE To scale-up our decarbonisation efforts, we advocate for transparency and accountability across the value chain.

The economic hardships, and environmental crises have all hampered progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In 2023, in the face of increasing levels of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, extreme weather conditions and loss of biodiversity, efforts to respond are accelerating. With digital transformation, increasing public awareness of sustainability, and inclusive development, focuses are shifting from safeguarding livelihoods to enhancing quality of life. Governments, businesses, and other institutions are taking important measures to move global sustainability towards a more harmonious relationship with nature and create a more prosperous society. The automotive industry is transitioning towards connectivity, autonomy, and electrification. There are both opportunities and challenges posed by decarbonisation process, as well as digital transformation. In 2023, BMW focused its investments on the electric and digital development of vehicles, along with advancements in autonomous driving technology. With significant progress in its electrification transformation, the BMW Group continues to strengthen its business foundation, confidently striding towards the new era of mobility. Following the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, 2023 was the first full year of implementation of policy guidance and a critical period for achieving a greener and more coordinated economic and social development. As an automotive company deeply rooted in China, the BMW Group China's future is intertwined with the Chinese market. Adhering to our philosophy of "At Home in China," we align our strategies with China's national sustainability priorities, taking concrete action to accelerate the adoption of electrification, digitalisation, and sustainable practices. DIALOGUE WITH STAKEHOLDERS As the sustainability concept continues to grow, governments, customers, employees and other stakeholders pay close attention to a company's performance in environmental protection, social responsibility, and corporate governance. As the BMW Group China, we continue to expand the scope of our sustainable development and disclosure, broaden our range of communication channels, and maintain close engagement with various stakeholders. Adhering to the commitment of "at Home in China", we engage in dialogue with local governments, customers, employees, and suppliers to foster longterm, mutually beneficial partnerships built on trust.

It offers enterprises efficient action directions and key topics for sustainability reports, and is essential for disclosure. In 2022, the BMW Group China conducted a materiality assessment to identify and prioritise the sustainability issues that matter most to our business and key stakeholders. The assessment formed a matrix, with the horizontal axis representing the significance of the environmental and social impact of the BMW Group China, and the vertical axis representing relevance to the BMW Group China's business success. This matrix provides us with clear guidance, enabling us to focus more on advancing sustainability efforts and contributing to the harmonious coexistence of the economy, society, and the environment. OUR MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT PROCESS Defining Issues We began by listing 20 potential issues grouped into four categories: Â· Product Responsibility Â· Environmental Â· Social Â· Governance Prioritising Issues We collected over 350 questionnaires from a representative cross-section of our eight stakeholder groups, followed by 15 in-depth interviews with internal and external stakeholders. The result is a materiality matrix revealing the nine issues considered most relevant to BMW Group China as well as our stakeholders. Strategic Priorities We then grouped material issues into our strategic priorities. Our China Board has reviewed the results of our materiality analysis to validate the importance of each topic, and upon validation, we began crafting detailed action plans to deliver our commitment within each for each priority.

At the core of our leadership stands the BMW China Board, which directs the integration of sustainability into all key business decisions, leading our company on a path of sustained growth and advancement. Sustainability Governance at the BMW Group China Board Level CHINA BOARD Management Level CHINA SUSTAINABILITY CIRCLE DEDICATED SUSTAINABILITY CIRCLES CROSS-FUNCTIONAL AND DIVISIONAL CIRCLES The annual target-setting process, where sustainability holds a central feature, necessitates business functions to establish and achieve specific targets. This allows us to systematically implement the China Board's guidance, ensuring accountability within each business function. The China Board also shoulders the crucial responsibility of ensuring our company's operations adhere to the law and internal regulations, along with carrying out adequate risk management and control measures. To guide our sustainable development, we have a dedicated China Sustainability Circle that provides regular updates and progress reports to the China Board, assigns tasks, and solicits feedback to ensure that sustainability remains at the forefront of our business. Our Dedicated Sustainability Circles focus on our production and supply chain, while cross-functional and divisional circles strive to implement sustainability initiatives across the company. We foster feedback channels for our operations to facilitate collaborative efforts toward sustainable development across the organisation. On a daily basis, our internal business functions spearhead the implementation of sustainability-related decisions made by the China Board. This process is also guided and monitored by Management Circles across various business functions. Regular evaluations by these Circles guarantee that Board of Management directives are transformed into concrete action plans, and are then implemented at the operational level for implementation. ENHANCING CLIMATE RISK ASSESSMENT AND RESILIENCE The Earth's climate is undergoing significant changes. Extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, droughts, and rising sea levels, are becoming more frequent. Climate risks not only pose a threat to the balance of natural ecosystems but also create serious challenges to the operational stability of businesses, supply chains, and even global social security. As a crucial part of the socio-economic landscape, enterprises must recognise the risks brought by climate change and take corresponding measures to enhance climate resilience. In 2023, we maintained our commitment to the ongoing evaluation and management of climate risks. By analysing risks against relevant standards, conducting physical risk and transition risks assessments for the whole company, we implemented countermeasures across plants, projects, and daily operations, building climate risk capacity, and encouraging employee efforts to address climate change.

Compliance Governance Structure BOARD OF DIRECTORS / AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT / CORPORATE GOVERNANCE & COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE & COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT COMPLIANCE OPERATIONS NETWORK ROBUST GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE At BMW Group China, our governance structure encompasses a wide network of compliance management boards, functions and roles to implement an effective Compliance Management System (CMS) at each entity. Based on the "three-lines model", the CMS is embedded in each entity's overall risk management system. -- Business departments are the "first line", which is responsible for lawful conduct during the performance and operation of the daily business to ensure compliance requirements and processes are implemented accordingly. -- The Compliance organisation is the "second line", which supports the "first line" business departments with exercising their compliance responsibilities. A multi-layer comprehensive compliance organisation is in place, consisting of Group Compliance and Divisional Compliance functions, as well as local compliance functions and Compliance delegates/ambassadors. -- Corporate audit is the "third line", which is responsible for independent auditing of compliance structures, processes and systems that support company management, monitoring functions and operational management. -- Compliance committees are management boards that supervise and approve activities, as well as manage compliance and reputation risks. BMW Group China has implemented a robust organisational framework to uphold accountability across its operations. At the joint venture BMW Brilliance, for example, compliance accountability at the shareholder level resides with the Board of Directors (BoD) and the Audit and Compliance Committee (AC). The Board of Management (BoM) and the Corporate Governance and Compliance Committee (BCC) provide primary oversight. Across all BMW Group China entities, there are clearly defined roles and responsibilities to enable effective compliance implementation. Business departments, the first line, are responsible for identifying compliance risks within their daily operations, assessing these risks in alignment with corporate objectives, and implementing controls to mitigate them. All departments also have a designated Compliance Interface role (Compliance Interfaces), to serve as a bridge between business units and the central compliance function. Legal and responsible conduct is fostered through coordination between the central compliance function, designated compliance oversight roles, and business departments. For all entities of BMW Group China, the Corporate Governance & Compliance department oversees compliance programs. Other departments, such as Legal Affairs, Controlling, Tax, Customs and Export Control, IT, Corporate Quality, and Human Resources, also broadly serve as compliance steering functions by providing guidance on compliance-related matters within their respective areas of expertise. 23 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 VISIONARY DIRECTION FUNDAMENTAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES Corporate Governance PRODUCTION AND OPERATION DEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETY OTHER INFORMATION THREE-STAGE APPROACH TO COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND COMPLIANCE TOPICS The BMW Group China's Compliance Management System (CMS) is based on the Prevent, Detect, and Respond Model, which defines specific measures for prevention, monitoring, control and response. The CMS is customised to BMW Group China entities' risk situation and addresses all relevant compliance topics. These topics include antitrust compliance, corruption prevention, fraud prevention, data compliance, export control, and anti-money laundering, among others. Our compliance management system is well-rounded. At the corporate level, the BMW Group Code of Conduct integrates the corporate principles of the BMW Group. For employees and the public, it offers transparency about key compliance areas. Based on the Code, we have internal policies and processes that reflect the legal requirements for compliance concerns. Through compliance risk assessment, we can identify business-specific compliance risks and mitigation measures. We attach great value to training and compliance awareness promotion to support the integration of compliance in our business culture. IT-driven compliance systems enable transparent and efficient documentation, assessment, and approval of compliance-related issues. The BMW Group China SpeakUP Line notification system is promoted to address questions and concerns appropriately. In addition, we have various monitoring levels to periodically review adherence to and implementation of compliance rules and processes. BMW Group China also encourages business departments to take more proactive measures related to anti-fraud, including job rotation for high fraud-risk positions, and enhancement of subcontracting management. At the same time, we actively identify fraud leads and address root causes. The BMW Group urges all employees to avoid situations that may result in a conflict of interest. Any risk of conflicts of interest should be disclosed and documented in a transparent manner. Local companylevel instruction on conflicts of interest is in place to form a sound basis and provide immediate guidance to this topic. In 2023, a series of actions have been implemented on conflicts of interest, including trainings, all-staff communications, and declaration, to further raise awareness, mitigate risks and ensure transparency. In 2023, stronger collaboration between Group and local compliance functions ensures various Group compliance initiatives are effectively implemented with local adaption and customisation. Among other initiatives, the Group Compliance Management System Certification Project aims to enhance and provide further assurance of compliance management system effectiveness at both Group and local level.

The videos were communicated through multiple internal channels, such as the Associates Communication Letter, BMW China Intranet Newsletter and E-poster, JoyChat App, Compliance Day Event, as well as, the new associates onboarding compliance package. The Annual Compliance Quiz, which incorporated both a self-learning package and interactive questions in the form of materials such as notebook, pen, or calendar, was another well-recognised and innovative campaign. This regular compliance campaign aims to refresh compliance knowledge and raise awareness in an engaging and timely manner. Furthermore, compliance communication letters focusing on various compliance topics are sent to all associates or target groups to remind them of compliance risks and requirements on a regular basis, which also effectively helps to enhance compliance awareness and competence. We are dedicated to speaking directly to all associates on topics that matter to them.

Aligning operations with sustainability imperatives requires a comprehensive overhaul of energy strategies and a fundamental shift in resource utilisation approaches. In 2023, the BMW Group China's total energy consumption was 1,267,107 MWh. Fuel from non-renewable resources accounted for 24%, heating consumption for 22%, and electricity consumption accounted for 54%. GEOTHERMAL WELL FOR RENEWABLE HEATING To further reduce GHG emissions from heating, a geothermal well test was conducted in 2023 to explore the use of green heating in the Gen 6 Battery Powertrain Plant. With extensive research and collaboration with partners, we aim to have the first CO2 free heating plant in Shenyang, achieving a reduction in emissions of 18,000 t/year by 2025. ON-SITE SOLAR INSTALLATION In 2023, our on-site capacity of solar PV installation achieved 89.8 Megawatt peak (MWp) across our Shenyang base -- a 21% increase from 74.4 MWp in 2022. In 2023, the total powered-on capacity of solar PV has reached 90.2 MWp for the Shenyang base and the Beijing non-manufacturing operative site. Electricity generated by on-site solar PV was more than 89.66 Gigawatt hours (GWh), an increase of approximately 40% year-on-year. For direct emissions and emissions from purchased heat, our objective is to gradually transition to more efficient and clean energy options. In 2023, we accelerated the replacement of coal with natural gas, a fossil fuel with approximately 50% lower global warming potential. To increase energy efficiency, we continue accelerating the switch from coal boilers to natural gas heating and eventually electric boilers to complement our low carbon energy transition efforts. The system was installed in the Plant Tiexi and Powertrain Plant in 2023, following installation at the Plant Lydia and the Plant Dadong Extension in 2022. While the remaining GHG emissions from production operations primarily stem from natural gas consumption and purchased heat, we are actively exploring long-term solutions. Technical feasibility Green Electricity Consumption Categories at Production In GWh 380.30 373.75 432.18 assessments for various use cases are underway to evaluate alternative energy sources for heating, such as geothermal and biomethane gas, as sustainable replacements for fossil-based fuels. For electricity used in production, we have achieved 100% renewable electricity use. This comprehensive transition was facilitated through a multipronged approach: deploying on-site solar photovoltaic (PV) panel installations, securing green electricity via power purchase agreements (Green PPAs), and purchasing internationally recognised renewable electricity certificates (I-RECs). We continue to raise our standards for use of renewable electricity. We are committed to improve Green PPAs and the percentage of on-site solar electricity in our renewable electricity portfolio and gradually phase out use of green electricity certificates to provide more direct environmental benefits. In addition, we are exploring the feasibility of using other forms of renewable electricity, such as biomethane, to diversify our renewable electricity portfolio. Research indicates that it would be feasible for Powertrain Plant foundry equipment to consume biomethane and a test plan is in development.

We prioritise waste reduction, disposal management and recycling. We believe in waste reduction at the source, and practise waste classification through employee awareness programmes. We collaborate with suppliers to recycle steel and aluminium scraps from the production process. We are also exploring innovative solutions to minimise waste disposal volume. For example, using cement kiln joint disposal technology, we are able to use ceramic and iron mud from our engine factories as raw material for cement production through cooperation with third-party cement factories. We also installed sludge dryers at all vehicle plants, which reduce waste volume and weight by 40% to 50% via dehydration. The Powertrain Plant achieved zero landfill waste in January 2023, and we aim to achieve zero landfill waste for all vehicle plants from 2024. All potential and current waste-handling suppliers are subject to rigorous assessment to ensure regulatory compliant waste handling and disposal. This entails regular audits and on-site inspections of their documentation and waste management. VOCS EMISSIONS REDUCTION VOCs are organic solvents that are mainly emitted from paint shops in the vehicle production process. At the BMW Group China, we take a multilayer approach to reduce our VOCs emissions. First, by optimising our painting technique, we reduce paint usage while maintaining good coating results. Second, we are continually upgrading our coating materials to options with lower VOCs content. Third, we have on-site recycling to distil solvent1 used in painting for reuse. With our state-ofthe-art VOCs treatment facilities, we conduct real-time monitoring and digital management at all manufacturing sites. LAND USE AND BIODIVERSITY Sustainability is inherently intertwined with environmental and ecological preservation. In every stage of site selection, construction, and operation, we are dedicated to mitigating the footprint of our production on local vegetation, soil, and biodiversity. At our Shenyang manufacturing base, we integrate nature-based solutions into the planning and construction of new projects, such as sponge city design to collect and use rainwater and soil conservation techniques. At Plant Lydia, we have chosen indigenous plant species to reduce maintenance and watering and minimise impacts on the ecosystem. In this way, we support habitat rehabilitation for local plant and animal life. These efforts help us preserve biodiversity and minimise land degradation, while promoting ecological well-being in the surrounding environment. 1.

Green Supply Chain Management Enterprise Certificate Issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). 67 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 VISIONARY DIRECTION FUNDAMENTAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PRODUCTION AND OPERATION DEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETY Purchasing and Supplier Network OTHER INFORMATION RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN The upstream automotive supply chain involves the procurement of raw materials and parts, including steel, non-ferrous metals, and HVBs. A large share of automotive manufacturing's energy consumption and carbon emission comes from the production and processing of these materials. In China, BMW is dedicated to developing, alongside our value chain partners to make a significant impact in improving energy efficiency and accelerating the energy transition. Strong collaboration and partnership are needed within the supplier network to implement series of nationwide lowcarbon initiatives. For the existing supply chain energy structure and production technology, the adoption of renewable electricity is an effective and robust way to reduce carbon emissions in the supply chain. BMW Group specifies 100% renewable electricity usage in future BMW product manufacturing as part of the direct-supplier (Tier 1) nomination requirements. At the end of 2023, around 50% of supply chain electricity consumed by nominated local direct-supplier (Tier 1) for existing derivatives was committed to renewable sources. Meanwhile, 100% of our aluminium ingot foundry shop suppliers have already made their switch to renewable electricity since 2021, and all of our HVB cells suppliers have adopted 100% renewable electricity in their self-production process. To further empower our suppliers in the journey, we also enhanced our digital platform to assist the low-carbon transition. We have developed digital training modules to enrich suppliers' knowledge and level up management expertise of renewable electricity. Moreover, we also advised suppliers on the accessibility of renewable electricity based on local policies and regional conditions. Meanwhile, nominated suppliers report their electricity consumption for analysis via our Supplier Resource Dashboard. This allows BMW Group China to provide practical advice and insights to suppliers for energy efficiency improvement. ENABLING CIRCULARITY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN We adhere to the "Secondary First" principle to reduce dependency on primary resources while ensuring product quality. To this end, we are working to expand the different types and volumes of secondary materials in the supply chain. In 2023, we continued to collaborate with suppliers on precious metals, aluminium, and HVBs recycling. We also piloted secondary plastic materials usage to produce brand-new interior and exterior parts for new vehicles. For more information about our use of secondary materials, please refer to Product Resource Utilisation and Conservation. Precious metals Achieved over 70% secondary raw material use of palladium and rhodium since 2022. Aluminium ingot foundry Achieved 50% secondary raw material use as of the end of 2023. HVB Retired HVB closed loop for nickel, cobalt, and lithium recycling in 2023, secondary aluminium and nickel are used in battery cell production. Plastic 30% secondary thermoplastic material utilised in interior and exterior parts in our pilot vehicle project, such as rocker panel, bumper bracket, storage box, etc.. Aluminium casting Achieved 75% secondary raw material use in our Rim pilot project and supplier. 68 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 VISIONARY DIRECTION FUNDAMENTAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PRODUCTION AND OPERATION DEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETY Purchasing and Supplier Network OTHER INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TRANSFORMATION & PARTNERSHIP IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN Collaboration is the only way to achieve supply chain decarbonisation. We work alongside our supply chain partners to explore, develop, and leverage BMW's leading-edge technologies to bring tangible solutions to the table. To address the low carbon transition in aluminium for vehicle production, BMW Group China cooperated with suppliers to signed joint Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) for electrolytic aluminium and recycled aluminium. By enabling renewable electricity in electrolytic aluminium production and using recycled aluminium material, we can reduce carbon emissions by 14 tonnes and 18 tonnes carbon reduction per tonne of aluminium produced respectively, compared to traditionally sourced aluminium raw materials. To celebrate our sustainable development achievements with suppliers, BMW Brilliance Automotive hosted a Grand Supplier Day in 2023 with the theme of "Together, We Build a Sustainable and Resilient Supply Chain With Premium Quality". We also launched two Supply Chain Sustainability Awards - the CO2 Management Award and the Circular Economy Award - to recognise outstanding initiatives and encourage supplier excellence. The event reinforced communication and united BMW Group China with its suppliers amidst shared challenges. 1st Supply Chain Sustainability Awards granted on Grand Supplier Day. CO2 MANAGEMENT AWARD Shuaiyichi (Henan) New Material Technology Co., Ltd Shuaiyichi has actively supported BMW Group China's sustainable development. In addition to using 100% renewable energy for BMW Group China related production, Shuaiyichi tailored a closed-loop aluminium recycling system for BMW Brilliance Automotive. CIRCULAR ECONOMY AWARD Yanfeng Plastic Omnium (Shenyang) Automotive Exterior Systems Co. Yanfeng is contributing to the industrial chain of recycled materials and supporting the sustainability efforts of BMW Group China. Yanfeng rigorously sorts recycled materials by examining their density, colour, and near-infrared tests. It is estimated that the use of the recycled materials developed by Yanfeng could reduce carbon emissions by 20% to 50%, compared to primary materials. 69 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 VISIONARY DIRECTION FUNDAMENTAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PRODUCTION AND OPERATION DEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETY Purchasing and Supplier Network OTHER INFORMATION SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY INITIATIVES FOR SUPPLIERS Socially responsible supply chain management can create, protect, and grow long-term environmental, social, and economic value for stakeholders across the value chain. The BMW Group integrates environmental, social standards and governance factors into its corporate sustainability strategy. With this strategy, BMW Group China has implemented socially responsible supply chain practices, whilst complying with local regulations. The sustainability targets of environment, health and safety (EHS) and social responsibility have been achieved through diverse projects, including thirdparty evaluation of sustainability questionnaires and regular assessments. At the same time, we have enhanced supply chain transparency within the purchasing process with due diligence action. In 2023, BMW Group China updated our Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) with enhanced requirements for responsible business practices, the use of critical raw materials, and environmental and social responsibilities. SUPPLIER ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK MANAGEMENT BMW Group China believes that robust supplier EHS management and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practices are the foundation of a sustainable supply chain. We advocate all stakeholders in our supply chain working together to further enhance EHS risk management efficiency, achieving high-quality and resilient supply chain networks. Over the years, BMW Group China has cooperated extensively with suppliers to improve EHS performance and explore more efficient management approaches through BMW's Supplier EHS Management Programme. We engage independent third party service providers to conduct local risk-based EHS and CSR assessments so our suppliers can identify gaps and improve their capabilities. In 2023, we conducted onsite assessments at 38 suppliers and raised average performance levels from 88% to 94%. We are enabling sustainability management by using a digitalised ESG Risk Management System (ERMS) to monitor suppliers' sustainability performance. The supply chain risks can be identified and tracked precisely by its risk tracking functions. In 2023, more than 400 risk cases in our supply chain were identified and mitigated without causing any disruptions to our supply chain operations. ENHANCE SUPPLY CHAIN ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY WITH ACTIONS To reduce EHS risks and secure the supply of BMW parts, we require our Tier 1 suppliers to conduct assessments of their upstream sub-suppliers. These assessments are then jointly verified by BMW and the Tier 1 suppliers. This is called a "Challenge Round." By the end of 2023, we have cumulatively completed 100 such "Challenge Rounds" through both remote and onsite assessment. SUPPLIER TRAINING BMW Group China strives for continuous improvement in enhancing supply chain sustainability by continually raising our suppliers' awareness and knowledge of BMW's sustainability standards and requirements. We provide online training in Chinese and English as well as onsite training for suppliers on topics, such as social responsibility, EHS, and decarbonisation. In particular, to improve our circular economy performance, we encourage suppliers to share best practices of secondary raw materials with other suppliers. RESPONSIBLE SOURCING For BMW Group, responsible sourcing is the result of a holistic approach that considers economic, environmental, and social factors. We have formulated our Supplier Code of Conduct for raw material supply chains in accordance with environmental and social standards. On top of that, we also oblige Tier 1 suppliers to pass these requirements on to their upstream sub-suppliers. BMW Group focuses, in particular, on the conflict minerals tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (also known as 3TG). Utilising standardised tools from the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), BMW Group is able to trace these raw materials back to the smelter. We use existing certifications for other raw materials, and additionally BMW Group is also involved in developing certification standards for critical stages of the value chain, such as being part of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) and committed to the implementation by the suppliers. BMW Group has also set a goal to generate a positive impact from selected raw materials through local development projects, which currently includes lithium, mica, cobalt, and natural rubber. FORECAST We look forward to collaborating with suppliers to explore efficient ways to accelerate supply chain decarbonisation and social responsibility progress. By hosting supplier sustainability engagement events in the near future, we aim to provide a platform for suppliers to learn from experts, interact with peers, and explore the latest trends and solutions, thereby further implementing BMW's sustainability strategy within the supply chain. 70 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 VISIONARY DIRECTION FUNDAMENTAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PRODUCTION AND OPERATION DEALER AND SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETY OTHER INFORMATION CHAPTER 5 EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETY Dedicated to fostering a sustainable future, the BMW Group China is people-oriented.

EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE My favorite intercultural experience in China was the diverse range of food choices, each region offering unique flavors. I value the experience of traveling and learning about the country's food, art, and history. Diversity and inclusion can make teamwork more efficient, and different experiences allow teams to complement each other's strengths. I was surprised to learn that there are so many unconscious biases! Through learning, I hope to have better emotion management skills, stronger empathy, and find peace in work and life. ----Expatriate colleagues at BMW Brilliance's 20th Diversity Summer Carnival 81 BMW GROUP CHINA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 5.3 BENEFITS AND WELL-BEING BMW Group China, as a global enterprise with localised characteristics, embraces a people-oriented approach, prioritising the safety and happiness of over 28,000 employees.

We conduct safety-related activities throughout the company, including training sessions and emergency drills to enhance employees' safety awareness and capabilities. Through these ongoing measures, we continuously raise our employees' safety consciousness, so they can fully unleash their potential in a secure environment and contribute to a sustainable business. ROBUST OHS MANAGEMENT A robust occupational health and safety (OHS) management system is paramount to safeguarding the safety and well-being of our employees. By ensuring regulatory compliance, we can mitigate occupational health and safety risks and prevent accidents. The BMW Group China complies with all applicable Chinese laws and regulations, as well as the BMW Group's health and safety policy, to ensure that every employee works in a safe and healthy environment. Our OHS management system meets international and domestic policies and standards, such as the United Nations Global Compact, the ISO 45001:2018 standard and the International Labour Organisation's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. All BMW Brilliance manufacturing sites hold the ISO 45001:2018 accreditation, fulfilling the requirements of OHS management systems.

The mechanism supports controlling risks in plants, from organisational, institutional, technical and emergency perspectives. In 2023, the Today for Tomorrow > NEXT project, initially launched in 2021 in the assembly shop of Plant Tiexi, strengthened its impact on occupational health and safety hazard mitigation and risk management.

Based on the findings of our Safety and Ergonomics Risk Assessment (SERA) and on-site ergonomic behaviour observations in Plant Tiexi and the logistics department of Plant Dadong, our health department designed workplace exercises. These exercises can be easily integrated into employees' daily routines, offering relief from physical stress.

The previous years' figures have been adjusted for comparison purposes. 3. Include the emissions of company vehicles since 2023. 4. Include the emissions from heat purchased of nonmanufacturing sites since 2023. 5. The methodology used to calculate emissions changed in the 2023 reporting year. Enhancements to the IT system have made it possible to perform a differentiated calculation for all vehicles taking into account different energy mixes and carbon emission factors for different production regions. The values in the time series were adapted using this new methodology (values based on prior methodology for BMW Brilliance: 2019: 3,981,487 tCO2e, 2020: 4,339,177 tCO2e, 2021: 5,071,706 tCO2e, 2022: 5,179,693 tCO2e, 2023: 5,666,641 tCO2e; for BMW Group China: 2022: 6,410,297 tCO2e, 2023: 6,658,211 tCO2e). 6. Emissions of the vehicle-related purchased goods and services and disposal are calculated based on life cycle assessment as per ISO 14040/44 of representative vehicles from the product lines using the "LCA for Experts" tool provided by Sphera. 7. The increase in this figure is mainly due to the adjustments to emissions factors and the increase in weight transported. 8. The increase in this figure is mainly due to the increase of the total number of automobiles produced and imported by BMW Group China in Chinese mainland market. 9. Include employees' air travel for business purposes. The increase in this figure is mainly due to the increase in the frequency of domestic and international travel. 10. The increase in this figure is mainly due to the increase in production volume. 11.
