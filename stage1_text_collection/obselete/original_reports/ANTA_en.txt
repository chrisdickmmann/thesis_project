MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN

Dear Stakeholders,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our ESG Report for the year ended 31 December 2023. We move forward in the constantly evolving business environment, steadfastly adhering to the strategic layout of "Single-focus, Multi-brand, Globalization". We integrate a firm belief in sustainable development into our business, sparking new vitality for high-quality growth.

Promoting Responsible Business Operations, Building the Foundation of Corporate Governance
We firmly believe that responsible business operations are an essential foundation for the stable development of a company. We abide by the concept of "Value creation through Mutualism" by establishing a Sustainability Committee to ensure direct governance-level participation in sustainability issues, building the core values of "Mutualism with

Consumers, Mutualism with Partners, Mutualism with Employees, Mutualism with the Society, and Mutualism with the Environment". During the financial year, we enhanced the Group's corporate governance by performing the roles of Chairman and CEO through separate management personnel. We are dedicated to creating a comprehensive internal sustainability governance system, establishing a clear ESG governance structure with distinct levels and defined responsibilities, driving the effective implementation of

4 ANTA Sports Products Limited ESG Report 2023

sustainability strategies and objectives, and delivering sustainable value to all stakeholders.
As a participant member of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), we pledged to support the 10 Principles of the UNGC as well as our unswerving support to the realization of 17 SDGs of the United Nations. During the financial year, we joined the UNGC's "Forward Faster" initiative, becoming one of the first Chinese companies to join this initiative and the only participant from the textile and apparel

industry, and taking the lead in making commitments towards climate action. We also became a global signatory company member of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs) during the financial year, striving for gender equality and the empowerment of women in the workplace, market competition, and community life.
Advancing Industry Collaboration, Creating Value through Mutualism
We are committed to creating a legal, fair, just, and clean mutualism model, working hand in hand with our partners to achieve a win-win situation. During the financial year, we joined organizations such as the Leather Working Group (LWG) and Cascale (formerly known as the Sustainable Apparel Coalition), integrating sustainable development concepts into our procurement processes, continuously strengthening the requirements for raw material traceability, and ensuring that the raw materials and products meet production standards and ESG management requirements. We collaborate with third-party organization to conduct ESG risk assessments for both our suppliers and self-operated factories, and comprehensively consider various risks during the selection process to fully maintain supply chain stability. We

have also set a goal to achieve a 100% traceability ratio for sustainable leather sourcing after three years, building based on over 90% traceability ratio this year, further enhancing product safety guarantees.
We continue to pay attention to the standardization and professionalism of suppliers' management processes and empower our supply chain partners to improve their management capability. We published the "Supplier Sustainability Management Handbook", further clarifying the management standards in the areas of labor rights, health and safety, environmental responsibility, and sustainability management system in an effort to create a mutualism platform for building an environmentfriendly, healthy, safe and efficient supply chain. We are supporting suppliers to collect carbon emissions and energy usage data through digitization to improve their planning capabilities and management efficiency. At the same time, we are also promoting the sourcing of sustainable raw materials and giving priority to suppliers with traceability and sustainability certification to create a green supply chain. Furthermore, we will develop comprehensive carbon reduction plans for the value chain in line with the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) requirements, assisting suppliers in transitioning to low-carbon operations to co-create a

green development ecosystem. During the financial year, we had a total of 801 suppliers and conducted over 400 ESG audits completed by both our internal audit team and third-party organizations. Internal and external audits accounted for 24.4% and 75.6% respectively. We did not find any material violations during audits obtaining a grade of good or above accounts for more than 60%.
Integrating Innovative Strengths, Creating High-Quality Products
We firmly believe that product quality and technological innovation are the lifelines of our brand. Through technology research and development, we continuously inject new strength into enhancing our competitive edge and empowering sustainable development. We have joined the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) Programme and have developed and disclosed the "ANTA Sports Chemicals Management Manual", forming a comprehensive chemical management strategy. We are committed to providing consumers with high-quality products and incorporating the principles of circular fashion into our business operations,

adhering to a multi-brand layout to create diversified consumer value while offering high-quality products. During the financial year, we launched various sustainable products, including the ANTA Training Series, FILA FITNESS Series, etc. We also carried out carbon footprint assessments for three products. In terms of circularity, we have recycled 570,000 shoeboxes, 18 million sheets of shoe wrapping paper or packaging paper.
Enhancing Climate Resilience, Protecting Natural Ecology
We are actively promoting the "1+3+5" strategic goals for achieving mutualism with the environment, adhering to the development of green technology transformation practices, and accelerating the clean and low-carbon transformation of our business. We actively respond to the China's "Dual Carbon" goals, and during the financial year, we formally joined and pledged to support the commitment of the SBTi. We plan to set carbon reduction targets for our business. To better understand the climate risks and opportunities faced by the company, based on the recommendations of the TCFD

and the ISSB, we have established a climate change management system and mechanism from four perspectives: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets. We integrate climate change responses into the entire value chain of corporate operations, seeking business models to address climate change risks. During the financial year, our 2023 total GHG emission intensity reduced by 3.6% to 3.21 tons of CO2 equivalent/Revenue per million RMB, and total water consumption intensity reduced by 9.0% to 24.3 m3/ Revenue per million RMB, committing to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, and mitigating climate change. On the other hand, we conducted carbon audit for self-operated facilities and developed supply chain carbon reduction roadmap, by establishing carbon reduction target plan.
Promoting Diversity and Inclusion, Accelerating Employee Development
We consistently adhere to principles of fairness and justice, striving to create a diverse, inclusive, healthy, safe and open working environment. During the financial year, we published the "Labor

6 ANTA Sports Products Limited ESG Report 2023

Policy", committed to protecting the labor rights and fundamental rights and interests of our staff and to build a diverse and inclusive talent system. As of 31 December 2023, we had 60,500 employees with male and female employees accounting for 24.8% and 75.2%, respectively of the total, and female executives (director level and above) accounted for 36.6%. Based on our long-term development, we have dedicated considerable resources to establish an employee training system. The coverage rate of our employee training exceeded 95%. Average hours per employee of training exceeded 29 hours per year.
Fulfilling Social Responsibility, Devoting Efforts to Give Back to Society
Through a variety of public welfare activities, our public welfare covered a wide range of areas, including education, healthcare and rural revitalization. We continuously contribute to the public welfare and charitable causes through donations, public welfare activities and advocacy of social responsibility. During the financial year, we donated a total of

RMB59 million in cash and the value of donated sportswear (calculated at tag value) to different charities exceeded RMB250 million.
Through the "Sturdy Growth Charity Project", which has been implemented for many years, we have built 184 ADream Centers to provide teenagers with Adream courses. We trained 6,270 frontline physical education teachers through ANTA Physical Education Courses. The project covered over 6.62 million teenagers in 16,115 schools across 31 provincial administrative regions. We also actively participated in volunteer services, with an accumulated service time over 30,000 hours.
Persistently endeavor, across all moments and locales, to ascend to the zenith of success, never content with mediocrity, for only through ceaseless pursuit and exploration can one unveil truths and soar to unparalleled heights. ANTA Sports engraves the spirit of "Keep Moving" in its heart, and bravely and steadfastly walks the path of sustainable development. On the global market stage, driven by innovation and unwavering

determination, we will brave the winds and waves amidst challenges and adversities, implement "benchmarking against high standards", achieve highquality growth, and strive to develop into a leading multi-brand sportswear group in the world.

ESG Management Responsibilities
The Board has overall responsibility for the Company's ESG strategy and reporting. As the top ESG governance body of the Company, the Board is responsible for formulating the Company's sustainability management approach, strategy and objectives, and establishing and maintaining ESG risk management and internal control system. The Board is also responsible for preparing the annual ESG report and overseeing the reporting process.
In 2021, the Company established the Sustainability Committee. To align the Group's management structure with its strategic directions and to enhance the Group's corporate governance, the composition of the Sustainability Committee has been changed. Mr. Zheng Jie, an Executive Director, ceased to be a member of the Sustainability Committee and Mr. Tsui Yeung, the chief executive officer of the Performance Sports Group, has been appointed as a member of the Sustainability Committee. The Sustainability Committee currently consists of two Executive Directors, four Independent Non-Executive Directors and two executives designated by the Board, and, being delegated (with relevant authorities) by the Board, is responsible for assisting the Board (i) to conduct effective governance and oversight of ESG matters; (ii) to formulate and review the Group's sustainability strategic objectives; (iii) to lead and promote each department to improve its mindsets and operation initiatives in various business processes from the perspective of sustainability; (iv) to identify, assess and manage material ESG risks; and (v) to coordinate and standardize the collection of ESG related data and information to improve the

quality of ESG information disclosure. The Board wishes the Group's ESG governance effectiveness would be enhanced through the change of composition of the Sustainability Committee.
ESG Risk Management
We attach great importance to the potential impacts arising from ESGrelated risks and opportunities. We have proactively launched ESG risk management related work and incorporated the identification and management of ESG risks into the Group's risk management system. As such, the Board, through the Sustainability Committee, oversees the assessment of ESG risks and opportunities (including those related to climate change), ensures that appropriate and effective ESG risk management and internal supervision mechanisms are in place, and continuously monitors the implementation of relevant risk management strategies and the work quality. We also stress the identification, assessment and management of climate change related risks and opportunities and follow the "IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards" issued by the ISSB and the "Guidance on Climate Disclosures" by the HKEX, to work on and make disclosure on climate change related risks and response measures around the four major areas of governance, strategy, risk management, metrics and targets.
Review of ESG Goals and Progress
We have set up a group-level sustainability strategy and goals and established an ESG objectives management system. We regularly assess material ESG issues and report to the Sustainability Committee for

review and evaluation. The Sustainability Committee at the same time regularly monitors and tracks progress against agreed targets and initiatives and reports to the Board. In addition, to ensure the effective implementation of our sustainability strategy and to continuously improve our ESG management, we have incorporated ESG goals and indicators into the performance assessment of various key departments.

The Board contains a balance of skills, experience and diversity of perspectives appropriate to the requirements of the Group's business. The Board includes a balanced composition of Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors (including Independent NonExecutive Directors) so that there is a strong independent element on the Board, which can effectively exercise independent judgement. Board practice is in place so that any changes to the Board composition (if any) can be managed without undue disruption. Independent Non-Executive Directors are industry practitioners or experts in the Group's business, or have other skills and experience in other areas which enhance the Board members' balance of skills, experience and diversity of perspectives. Independent NonExecutive Directors can make a positive contribution to the development of the

Company's strategy and policies through independent, constructive and informed comments.
The Nomination Committee has conducted the annual review of the Board composition. Based on different measurable objectives on board diversity, including but not limited to, gender, age, cultural and educational background, ethnicity, professional experience, skills, knowledge and length of service, the Nomination Committee considered that board diversity has been achieved since 2021. In particular, after the appointment of each of Ms. Wang Jiaqian and Ms. Xia Lian as an Independent Non-Executive Director on 1 July 2021 and 1 July 2022, respectively, the Board is no longer a single gender board. The Nomination Committee (and the Board) recognises the importance and benefits of gender diversity at the Board level, and shall

44 ANTA Sports Products Limited ESG Report 2023

continue to take initiatives to identify more female candidate(s) to further enhance the gender diversity among the Board members with a target of 30% women in the Board by the end of 2030. At the same time, we value diversity at the employee level (including senior management), committing to the principle of meritocracy and respecting employees' personal choices, regardless of gender, age, religious beliefs, nationality, etc. We will continue to strive for gender diversity at the employee level, aiming to achieve a representation of women exceeding 40% in director-level positions and above by the end of 2030.

The Company takes reports of corruption seriously, and may conduct investigations pursuant to the "Whistleblowing Policy" of the Company if necessary. Material incidents relating to breaches of the "Anti-corruption Policy" shall be brought to the attention of the Board by the Risk Management Committee.
The Risk Management Committee would regularly review the implementation and

effectiveness of the "Anti-corruption Policy" (including ethical standards) to ensure that the policy remains relevant to the Company's needs and reflects both current regulatory requirements and good corporate governance practice and would also discuss and consider any revisions that may be required.
For further details of the "Anti-corruption Policy", please refer to the full text of the policy posted on the Company's website (ir.anta.com).
Internal Audit Function
The Group's internal audit function is performed by our internal audit department. The department plays an important part in the assessment of the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems of the Group and reports directly to the Risk Management Committee on a regular basis.
The internal audit department conducts audit on material controls, compliance with policies and procedures of the Group at both operational and corporate levels. Plans and tools for corrective actions and control improvements would be identified and communicated with operations management to address any issues, non-compliance or deficiencies identified. The department further monitors the implementation of its recommendations by the operations management and reports the outcome to the Risk Management Committee. The internal audit department is also responsible for substantial contract review to identify risks behind and

provide recommendation to the operations management.
The internal audit department regularly attends the Risk Management Committee meetings and reports their work. Significant findings (including any findings of substantial contract review and non-compliance or irregularity matters) can be reported directly and freely to the Risk Management Committee. The Risk Management Committee ensures sufficient resources (including annual budget and staffing) are allocated to the internal audit department for effective fulfilment of work objectives and responsibilities, and provides all necessary support.
Internal Supervision
We have formulated and refined multiple internal audit and compliance management systems, including the "Auditing and Supervision System", the "Auditing and Supervision Patrol System" and the "Audit and Supervision Penalty Management System". These systems provide detailed provisions regarding the professional competence, objectivity, independence, fairness, discipline, violation penalties, and related work procedures for auditors and supervisors, and parties involved can make complains to the Risk Management Committee if they have any objections. Third-party auditors conduct audits covering the entire Group, continually enhancing the Group's compliance level. In addition, we conduct audits covering all operational activities of the Group on an annual basis regarding anti-corruption and business ethics matters, including

46 ANTA Sports Products Limited ESG Report 2023

audits on control procedures regarding treasury management and procurement to prevent corruption and bribery. We at the same time through methods such as audits, inspections, investigations, and supervision, continuously monitor the business ethical standard of internal and partners. We effectively combat, penalize, and hold accountable for corrupt, fraudulent, and other noncompliant behaviors from multiple dimensions.
We follow the Company's "Anticorruption Policy" and the related internal execution systems, comply with the "Supervision Law of the People's Republic of China", the "Company Law of the People's Republic of China", and other national laws and regulations, and have established internal codes of conduct, such as the "Employee Handbook of ANTA Group", to set forth requirements for the conduct of all employees, suppliers, subsidiaries and joint ventures, and to clarify the Group's requirements, zero-tolerance and penalties in the areas of anti-corruption and bribery, anti-discrimination, information security, conflict of interest, anti-competition, anti-money laundering and insider trading. We also provide training on ethical standards to all employees, suppliers, and other relevant parties. For our employees, we link their compliance with our code of conduct to their remuneration and performance appraisal.
All of our employees are required to sign the "Integrity and Self-discipline Commitment" and we have added anti-corruption clauses in our standard "Employees' Labor Contract" to

strengthen internal anti-corruption measures. During the financial year, we have strengthened the supervision of employees' personal disciplinary violations and urged them to honor the basic principle of integrity.
Building Integrity Culture
We proactively build an anti-corruption culture and use both online and offline training to promote integrity culture to the Board, management and employees (including part-time employees and contractors). We have explored innovative forms of education, such as the promotion video on integrity culture, the animation Healthy Workplace and online quiz of anti-corruption knowledge and promoted their dissemination through our corporate account on social media, special website on corporate culture and the Company's video channels. We have adopted lively and easy-to-understand means of presentation to explain our code of conduct and anti-corruption related systems and initiatives, to enhance the understanding of the Company's business ethics requirements, and have conducted cautionary education with typical cases of violations. Additionally, we organize visits to anti-corruption

and cautionary education bases and special offline training for our employees to strengthen their anti-corruption awareness.
Supply Chain Integrity Management
Integrity is a core value of the Company and the foundation for achieving mutually beneficial development with our suppliers. Upholding a zero tolerance policy towards corrupt practices, we are committed to collaborating with suppliers to construct a fair and clean business environment. We require all suppliers to adhere to applicable anticorruption laws and regulations in their operating countries or regions. We also require them to establish anti-corruption policies and have monitoring program to verify compliance, hence to investigate and report any violations of relevant policies. We have established a series of policies and systems covering supplier integrity management requirements, including the "Code of Conduct for Suppliers of ANTA Sports", the "Supplier Sustainability Management Handbook", "ANTA Group Supplier Integrity and Compliance Management Measures" etc. We also signed "Integrity and AntiCorruption Agreement" with suppliers and received integrity undertakings

Key Performance in 2023
During the financial year, we organized integrity culture advocacy training for the board, management, employees (including part-time employees and contractors), and external suppliers, with a coverage rate of 100%.

ANTA Sports Products Limited ESG Report 2023 47

BUILDING A FOUNDATION THROUGH PROMOTING RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS OPERATION

from suppliers at the admittance stage. Furthermore, we insist on overseeing the integrity and compliance of our suppliers by continuously monitoring their ethical performance through conducting audit activities.
Meanwhile, we promote integrity education to suppliers through various channels, including supplier conferences and social media, to enhance their awareness of integrity and anti-corruption. We persist in supervising and managing the integrity performance of our suppliers and require the internal audit department to conduct independent investigations on suppliers suspected of violating the anti-corruption responsibility clause. Once confirmed, they will be resolutely dismissed and held accountable for

the relevant legal responsibilities in accordance with the law.
Whistleblowing Policy
The Group is committed to achieving and maintaining the high probity standards and ethical business practices and encouraging reporting of concerns of actual or suspected misconduct or malpractice by any employees and/or external parties in any matter related to the Group. The Company has adopted a "Whistleblowing Policy" to create a system for the employees and other persons or entities who deal with the Group (e.g. customers and suppliers) to raise concerns, in confidence and anonymity, with the Risk Management Committee (designated by the Board

with relevant authorities) about possible improprieties relating to the Group. The identity of the whistleblower would be treated with the strictest confidence.
The whistleblowing system established under the policy is intended:
· to build a culture of openness and transparency in the Group;
· to maintain internal corporate justice;
· to encourage employees and other persons or entities dealing with the Group to raise concerns about possible improprieties relating to the Group and to provide them with confidential reporting channels for such purposes; and

Key Performance in 2023

During the financial year, we have:
· No corruption-related litigation cases occurred.
· Regarding violations of the code of conduct (involving corruption, conflicts of interest, money laundering, insider trading, etc.), 22 punishment notices were issued, and all violations have been handled in accordance with the Group's policy and relevant national laws and regulations.
· The signing rate of the "Integrity and Anti-Corruption Agreement" by suppliers reached over 75%.

As of 31 December 2023, we received and processed a total of 178 reports, including: 137 reports related to retail matters, 20 reports of violations and misconduct, 14 reports related to corruption, one report on professional ethics, two reports on managerial negligence, and four reports unrelated to our employees. All reported cases have been investigated and handled by dedicated personnel following the Group's policies, and we also provided training for employees.

48 ANTA Sports Products Limited ESG Report 2023

· to enable the Group to detect and deter or remedy a misconduct or malpractice in the Group before serious damage is caused.
The "Whistleblowing Policy" is applicable to all employees of the Group at all levels and to other persons or entities who deal with the Group (e.g. customers and suppliers). Whistleblowers may choose to report a misconduct to the designated ethics officers (being the Chairman and the chairman of the Risk Management Committee) or the Group's internal audit department.
For further details of the "Whistleblowing Policy", please refer to the full text of the policy which is published on the Company's website (ir.anta.com).
We are committed to taking corruption reports seriously and have adopted options of 7x24 independent reporting channels, including email, hotlines, WeChat and mailbox. We also have dedicated investigators with professional skills to investigate and handle whistleblowing reports and notify whistleblowers of the results where permitted by law. Meanwhile, we promise to strictly protect the lawful rights of whistleblowers and prohibit any retaliation against whistleblowers. We accept anonymous reports and have multiple protection measures in place to prevent retaliation, especially for entities or individuals who make whistleblowing reports in their real names. The Company strictly prohibits any retaliation, including any unjust disciplinary actions or dismissals due to

whistleblowing, and will make the best effort to take reasonable measures to protect whistleblowers from retaliation. Persons who victimize or retaliate against those who have genuinely raised concerns in good faith under this policy will be subject to disciplinary actions. Should circumstances arise in which the Company is required to disclose the whistleblower's identity, the Company will, to the extent permitted by law, endeavor to protect the reasonable interest of the whistleblower. We would review the previous reported cases to determine the effectiveness of whistleblowing management practices and potential areas for improvement in the future. This helps uphold our commitment to business ethics and promotes the continuous development of a transparent and accountable culture.
Information Security
Information Security Management System
We attach great importance to information security and the protection of employee personal information, strictly abide by the "Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China", the "Data Security Law of the People's Republic of China", and other laws and regulations. Accordingly, we have built and implemented an information security management system, and formulated a well-rounded information security management policy matrix consisting of 28 information security systems, including the "Penalty Rules of the Information Security Regulations" and the "Rewards and Discipline Policy"

that are established for specifying zerotolerance issues and the rewards and punishment of employees violating information security regulations, as well as the "Validity Measurement Procedures", which provides the standards for the assessment of data and network security. We strive to improve the information security and privacy protection system covering the entire Group and external suppliers. Through assessing the appropriateness, adequacy and effectiveness of the contents, as well as launching internal reviews on an annual basis, we continuously revise the relevant policies. During the financial year, we completed amendments to 37 clauses in our information security management system. In addition, we formulated "Personal Information Security Incident Emergency Response Manual" and revised documents such as the "Personal Information Protection Management Policy" and the "Employee Personal Information Protection Implementation Rules" to further enhance the security management of corporate data and personal information, and to incorporate privacy protection risks into the Group's overall risk management system.
At the supervisory level, we established the Personal Information Protection Office as the data security management entity. This office is responsible for formulating strategies for data security and personal information protection, reviewing and making decisions on significant matters, and overseeing the execution of related tasks. The Vice President of the Legal Management Department and the Deputy IT Director of

ANTA Sports Products Limited ESG Report 2023 49

BUILDING A FOUNDATION THROUGH PROMOTING RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS OPERATION

Information and Digitalization jointly serve as the heads of personal information protection. The Sustainability Committee reviews the Group's information security issues and reports to the Board. We have established an Information Security Management Committee and a specialized monitoring and enforcement team to assist in the establishment of a security management system. Our measures include building an ISO 27001 information security management system, a data leakage prevention system, performing penetration testing, conducting offensive and defensive drills, implementing proactive and passive defense plans, and taking measures such as security monitoring, threat warning, and emergency response for core systems to trace abnormal behavior.
Ensuring Information and Privacy Security
We have implemented a series of measures at both the hardware and software levels to ensure the security of core information and data. These measures include the use of dynamic passwords, data locking to prevent copying, unauthorized channel control, etc. By refining the permissions within core positions, we rigorously guard against information theft. During the financial year, major updates have been made in strengthening identity and access management, including the implementation of multi-factor authentication, detailed permission controls, and enhanced monitoring of privileged accounts. In the event of information theft cases, we enforce

disciplinary actions according to procedures and make public announcement on social media to serve as a warning.
In order to better manage potential information security risks, we conduct checks regularly and make timely corrections on information system vulnerabilities and unauthorized access to personal privacy. We prioritize regular information security testing, including quarterly vulnerability scans and risk assessments using industry-leading tools, and penetration testing to identify remediation and improvement measures. During the financial year, we invited professional external security companies to conduct attack and defense drills, simulating actual attack scenarios and cover multiple attack paths, to further enhance the information security team's defense capabilities against various cyber attacks.
Information Security Review
We conduct internal and external audits related to information security every year. During the financial year, we engaged a qualified third-party organization to carry out an external audit for ISO 27001 information security, covering all areas related to information security management. We completed the Groupwide internal audit during the financial year, and also consistently performed internal reviews and assessments related to information security and personal privacy protection. This included reviews of internal data access and self-assessment of the impact

on personal information protection. Based on the assessment results, we provide suggestions for modifications and follow up on improvements. During the financial year, the overall situation of our internal audit complies with the requirements of the information security management system, and no significant non-compliance issues were identified.
Information Security Incident Response
Through employee reporting and the involvement of the Personal Information Protection Office, we have been able to respond and resolve information security incidents in a timely manner. We have established an emergency response mechanism for information and privacy security to deal with information security incidents or any data privacy concerns raised by data subjects promptly, and develop compliant and effective remedial solutions and emergency plans. In accordance with internal regulations such as the "Personal Information Security Incident Emergency Response Manual" and the "Information Security Incident Management Policy", if there is any suspicion of personal securityrelated incidents, employees can report following the specified procedures. The information security department will organize different degrees of investigation, evaluation, processing, reporting, and summarizing based on the level of the incident; and the Personal Information Protection Office will arrange for the relevant department to handle the incident according to the emergency response plan.

Climate change poses potential risks to global social and economic development and simultaneously threatens the stability of business operations and asset security. We actively respond to "Dual Carbon" goals, committing to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. We identify, assess, and manage climate-related risks, continually attach importance to the environment protection and the pursuit of ecological civilization. We are committed to incorporating sustainability into corporate activities and decision-making. We incorporate the green, low-carbon, and environment-friendly principles into the entire product lifecycle, including product design, packaging, logistics, production, operation, and final product stages. This approach aims to conserve energy, resources, and reduce emissions and waste generation.

52 ANTA Sports Products Limited ESG Report 2023

Combating Climate Change
As an enterprise at the forefront of addressing climate change and promoting green growth, we actively explore the economic opportunities and challenges that climate change may bring to our business. Based on the recommendations of the TCFD and the ISSB, we have established climate change management system and mechanism from four perspectives: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Targets and Performance. We integrate climate change responses into the entire lifecycle of corporate operations, seeking business models to address climate change risks.
Governance
To address climate change-related impacts and challenges, we have established an ESG management framework comprising the Board, Sustainability Committee, and the Sustainability Department. This framework is also applicable to the management of climate change-related risks. ESG risks, including climate change risks, have been integrated into the Group's risk management framework and system. The Board, as the decision-making body, has the ultimate and overall responsibility on the Group's climate change related matters and the management of its risks and opportunities, with supervising on the Sustainability Committee's work and receipt of the committee's reporting. The Sustainability Committee, with responsibility for climate-related issues, assists the Board in establishing strategic objectives based on the identification of climate-related risks and opportunities. It collaborates in

allocating responsibilities, costs, and resources, conducts daily supervision and reporting on the progress of specific management tasks and objectives, ensuring the effective implementation of climate changerelated initiatives. Under the guidance of the Sustainability Committee, the Sustainability Department collaborates with relevant responsible people of each department and business unit to promote the identification and assessment of climate change risks, the assessment of financial impacts, and the implementation of related management strategies. This ensures proactive anticipation, effective decision-making, and active engagement in climate change action. To better manage the progress toward achieving goals related to climate change risks, we have incorporated ESG performance indicators, including the reduction of carbon emissions, energy consumption ratios and progress towards carbon neutrality targets, into the annual performance assessments and compensation linkage for management, business managers, and department staff.

Strategy
In order to better understand the impact of climate change on our business, we carefully assess the physical risks, transition risks and opportunities of climate change on business marketing of the significant component of our business. In relation to our business segments and with reference to the climate scenarios proposed by the United Nations IPCC, NGFS and other institutions, we have constructed three climate scenarios, i.e. 1.5°C scenario, 2°C scenario and 3°C scenario, for the short-term (0-5 years), mediumterm (6-10 years) and long-term (up to 2050) timeframes. The scenariobased assessment of the physical environment and socioeconomic environment lays the foundation for identifying key climate parameters, and provides the basis for further identifying the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on our business, strategy and financial planning. The impact of climate-related risks and opportunities were assessed respectively for short-term, mediumterm and long-term to determine priority for further risk management.

In accordance with the TCFD, the ISSB, and the HKEX Reporting Guide, we conducted group-wide business assessment for risks and opportunities followed by departmental interviews during the financial year. This multi-disciplinary management program identified and analyzed climate change-related risks and opportunities based on the actual business units and operations of the Group. This includes two categories of four potential physical risks, four categories of eight potential transition risks, and four categories of eight potential opportunities identified through a combination of existing management measures and improvement directions. We also assessed their impact on the Group's business, strategy, and finances.

Impact on business, strategic and financial planning

Typhoon

Fujian, China, Guangdong, China and other southeast coastal areas are typical landing spots of typhoons. Given the possible increase in the frequency of typhoons as a result of climate change in the future, the stability of buildings such as warehouses and factories as well as operations will be undermined, and increase the cost of infrastructure maintenance, leading to higher losses of production and operation interruptions. Some products may face disruptions in logistics and transportation, leading to delayed deliveries or damages. This could result in increased logistics time costs and compensation expenses.

Flood

Road transportation is the main form of cargo transport in the Mainland China. Increased frequency of floods may disrupt highway traffic, jeopardizing the logistics and transportation of certain products. This could result in delayed deliveries, impaired product quality, or a reduction in the Group's product sales revenue.

Extreme changes in rainfall patterns and weather patterns

Increased frequency of extreme weather patterns such as floods, typhoons and thunderstorms caused by climate change will have a significant impact on agriculture, may result in increased costs for natural fibers such as cotton. Extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall, may also affect product quality, leading to potential losses in the Group's operating revenue.

Average temperature rise

The rise in average temperature caused by climate change may affect the yield of agricultural products, which may lead to a reduction in production of natural fibers such as cotton in the long term, pushing up the purchase price and eventually affecting corporate revenues;
The increase in hot weather may lower the work efficiency of employees and jeopardize their health and safety, pushing up the expenses of high-temperature subsidies and medical care as well as may suppress demand for outdoor sports, resulting in lower consumer demand for outdoor products.

Higher pricing for GHG emissions
Enhanced emissions reporting obligations
Existing requirements and regulation of products and services

Under a carbon-reduction scenario, the consumer goods sector may be further incorporated into the carbon pricing mechanism in Mainland China's carbon trading market; the EU is already planning to issue a carbon border tax requirement for the textile industry. A carbon price could set the direction for the market and encourage low-carbon energy consumption and innovation in low-carbon technologies. If the Group emits more GHG emissions than it is allowed to, it will incur extra operating costs in the long term.
ANTA Sports is listed on the HKEX. Currently, the HKEX requires listed companies to disclose GHG emissions, and plans to further enhance the reporting obligations related to climate risks. It is expected that before 2025, listed companies will be required to disclose information related to climate risks. The Group will be exposed to operational and compliance risks if it fails to accurately disclose its emissions data.
The requirements and regulation of products and services may drive up the cost of professional training for the Group's sales personnel;
Government or industry associations may impose increasingly stringent requirements on the energy consumption standards of the products and the carbon intensity of the industry, including possible requirement for the carbon footprint label of products or carbon intensity per unit weight of product, or even phasing out high-emission products.

Failure on new technology investment

At various stages, including the product design phase, the failure of investments in clean and low-carbon technologies may lead to extra investment for the Group.

Cost of lowcarbon technology transition

As a leading company, ANTA Sports is expected to undertake greater obligations of carbon emission reduction and in the product design phase will face greater energy saving and carbon reduction technology investment; in addition, new technologies and processes required for low-carbon production will lead to the replacement and iteration of existing equipment, which will bring down the value of corporate assets.

Rising costs of raw materials

The increased frequency of floods, typhoons, thunderstorms, and extreme high/low temperatures weather caused by climate change will push up the prices of natural fibers and other raw materials required for our production, which will increase the procurement cost of raw materials and may ultimately affect our revenue.

Transition risk

Reputational risk

Change in consumer preference
Increased stakeholder concerns and negative feedback

As the impact of climate change becomes increasingly significant, and the concept of sustainable development deepens, consumers' willingness to engage in green consumption is growing. Consumers are inclined to purchase more environmentfriendly and sustainable products and services. If the Group fails to meet consumer preferences in a timely manner or consider the R&D of environmentally sustainable products from a product design perspective, it may result in revenue loss for the Group.
An increasing number of investors are highly concerned about corporate climate change actions in line with ESG investment criteria such as the Principles for Responsible Investment, and are increasingly concerned about corporate climate risk and carbon emission performance and targets. If we fail to take proactive steps toward decarbonization at the product design stage, investors may undervalue us, resulting in a negative impact on the Group's reputation and financing costs.

Adopting more efficient transportation methods

By optimizing the logistics and transportation structure and routes, implementing new energy vehicle procurement for transportation to enhance logistics efficiency and reduce energy consumption.

Opportunity

Resource efficiency

Recycling and reuse

By embedding requirements for circularity and low carbon throughout the entire life cycle of the product, including packaging design, production, use, and recycling, we can effectively reduce the product's carbon footprint and raw material consumption. This not only lowers the procurement costs of raw materials but also maximizes the reduction of environmental impact.

Transition to more efficient buildings

By improving the energy resource efficiency of both new and existing buildings, we can effectively reduce energy resource consumption and decrease operational costs. For instance, adopting green building design standards, including LEED, for logistics and warehouse facilities enhances climate change adaptability, leading to reduced mid-tolong-term operational expenditures.

Using more efficient production and distribution processes

By adopting high-energy-efficient production equipment and processes, establishing green factories and digitally intelligent workshops, and optimizing process management and operational efficiency, we can reduce GHG emissions.

Developing and/or increasing lowcarbon goods and services

With the government's heightened emphasis on green consumption and/or continuous improvement of industry standards for green products, actively developing green and low-carbon products or adding complementary services will help businesses expand their market presence and stimulate growth across different sectors.

Using lowcarbon energy

By utilizing clean energy in major energy-consuming segments, such as production operations and logistics transportation, and promoting low-carbon technologies and the application of new energy equipment, we can improve our efficiency and reduce operating costs.

Resilience

Resource substitution/ diversification

By incorporating diverse resource applications, including sustainable materials, the Group can reduce dependence on specific energy/resources, lower raw material costs, enhance supply chain stability, and strengthen resilience to climate risks.

Risk Management
We have incorporated climate risk management into our strategy and enterprise risk management, and the Sustainability Committee is responsible to coordinate the implementation of climate-related risk management in all departments and business units. For the purpose of comprehensive management of risks and opportunities associated with climate change, we

conduct extensive research on climate change trends in the operational regions of us, industry risk reports, and other relevant data. We integrate our business characteristics and development plans, taking factors such as operational scope and processes into account to establish a climate change risk list. Through interviews and surveys, we integrated multi-disciplinary departments to conduct group-wide analysis of the potential impacts of

climate change on business operations, as well as the potential financial consequences with assessment criteria including likelihood, impact, time-horizon (short-term, mediumterm and long-term) and so on. This approach allows us to subsequently rank identified climate-related risks and opportunities based on their significance and further determine priority.

We conducted a geospatial assessment of physical risks faced by us based on data from NASA Sea Level Projection Tool, World Resources Institute Aqueduct, U.S. NOAA Historical Hurricane Tracks, IPCC WGI Interactive Atlas, and relevant publications from academia and industry associations. The analysis also considered scenarios of 1.5°C, 2°C, and 3°C temperature increases.

Regions in Mainland China Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong Southeast Coastal Areas
Beijing, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Jiangsu
Xizang Tibetan Autonomous Region, South China Region

Geospatial Risk Assessment of Physical Risks
Flood Risk: Significantly impacts key provinces1, with the highest risk level in these three provinces;
Typhoon Risk: Mainly concentrated in the southeast coastal areas, with southern China, including Guangdong, China will also be a key area of concern for the Group;
Extreme Rainfall Risk: The impact on these provinces increases over time (comparing 2050 to 2030), and the current and future business layout is a key area of concern and assessment for this risk;
Extreme Heat2: Shows a significant rising risk trend in Xizang Tibetan Autonomous Region, China and the South China region, with Southern China, including Guangdong, China will also be a key area of concern for the Group.

1 Provinces requiring special attention: During the evaluation period, the total number of locations, including retail stores, self-operated factories, office buildings, and logistics centers exceeds 750.
2 Due to the lack of comprehensive database that can match the assessment of extreme high temperature risks across Mainland China, the conclusions of this analysis are based on information from NOAA Climate.gov and research paper "Seasonal Variations and the Connection to Extreme Temperature Events in Mainland China Over the Past 48 Years".

In response to various types of climate change-related risks, we have developed specific measures for our operational practices. For physical risks such as typhoons, floods, and extreme weather events, we have established comprehensive emergency responsive plans applying for various production and operational management modules, and regularly review the effectiveness of climate emergency responsive plans and management to ensure the stable operation. Based on the concept of coexistence between corporate development and the environment,

we continuously expand efforts and measures in areas such as biodiversity conservation. We conducted carbon footprint assessments and implemented energy conservation and other related plans drive green and low-carbon development in the value chain and consumer sectors. While enhancing our climate adaptability and sustainable competitiveness, we actively respond to the green development trend, promoting the lowcarbon development of our business.

Compared to 2022, we have further improved our statistical abilities by including additional GHG emissions from acetylene, CO2 fire extinguishers, and septic tanks, leading to an increase in Scope 1 emissions. Additionally, we have started accounting for emissions from purchased cooling and heating. Also, due to the business expansion in 2023, the number of ANTA's and ANTA KIDS' DTC stores has increased, resulting in a rise in purchased electricity, which had led to an increase in the Scope 2 GHG emissions.

3 Scope 1 GHG emissions are mainly from direct emissions from fossil fuel consumption (such as gasoline, diesel, natural gas, acetylene), refrigerant, carbon dioxide fire extinguishers and septic tank emissions, during operation/production process and the refrigerants emission. The formula used to calculate the main GHG emissions from fossil fuel consumption: CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion = fuel consumption x low level heat generation x carbon content per unit calorific value x fuel carbon oxidation rate x 44/12, while the calculation of refrigerant emissions data refers to "How to prepare an ESG Report - Appendix 2: Reporting Guidance on Environmental KPIs" issued by the HKEX, and the corresponding emission factors refer to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The calculation of septic tank emission data was estimated based on the number of employees and the number of working days per month.
4 Scope 2 GHG emissions are mainly from indirect emissions generated from purchased electricity and steam, purchased cooling and purchased heat consumed in the Group's operation/production process, calculated with reference to "How to prepare an ESG Report - Appendix 2: Reporting Guidance on Environmental KPIs" issued by the HKEX. The electricity emission factor 0.5703 tCO2/ MWh for Scope 2 Indirect GHG emissions in 2023 is adopted from "Notice on the management of GHG emission reporting by enterprises in the electricity generation industry from 2023 to 2025" issued by Ministry of Ecology and Environment on 7 February 2023.

In the meantime, we conduct general or key controls over our waste recycling partners, depending on the circumstances. We communicate our environmental policy to them, obtain their waste recycling and treatment results, and follow up when necessary. During the financial year, we have conducted hazardous waste training at each factory to ensure that our employees understand and implement the waste management system.

Waste Sorting and Treatment Measures
· Recyclable waste: This includes waste scraps, waste packaging materials, and discarded products, which are collected and temporarily stored in the general solid waste storage area for reuse or periodically sold externally;
· Non-recyclable waste: including domestic and engineering wastes that have no recycling value. These types of waste are collected by the environmental sanitation department for centralized disposal;
· Hazardous waste: A hazardous waste storage warehouse is established, and the in-and-out management of hazardous materials is strictly controlled according to relevant hazardous waste regulations. Hazardous items are placed in repurposed empty barrels for recycling, with clear signage, and are regularly entrusted to a qualified third-party organization for recycling and processing.

FILA Store Waste Recycling and Utilization
To maximize resource utilization and ensure environmental sustainability during the process of store closure, FILA stores have developed and implemented a set of management measures for utilization of the obsolete materials. Under the premise of not affecting the store's image, we recycle relatively new shelves and some equipment left behind after the closure. We have adopted a life-reshaping approach to handle basic renovation waste, including floor tiles, cement slag, wooden boards, gypsum boards, light steel keels, and electrical wires, and we track the disposal of these items. The recyclable materials such as floor tiles, cement slag, wooden boards, and gypsum boards are crushed at waste treatment stations, filtered into soil and sand, and then used to make cement bricks for secondary use. Wooden waste is collected by manufacturers and crushed to create particle boards. Additionally, some light steel keels and wires are also reprocessed and melted down to be transformed into reusable metal raw materials.

Other supply risks

We and our partners may face uncertainties such as financial deterioration or financial loss in the supply chain due to potential risks involving suppliers, such as financial problems and shareholder disputes, which could affect business transactions between enterprises and aggravate financial risks.

· Conduct supplier audit at the admittance stage to make sure that only qualified suppliers are included, and continuously monitor and give warning to abnormal indicators at the audit stage;
· Activate emergency management process in time under abnormal conditions, conduct loss inventory and impact assessment, and ensure rapid delivery by developing new suppliers;
· Thoroughly investigate the cause of the incident, seek accountability of the personnel involved in the incident, and formulate a preventive mechanism to avoid the recurrence of similar problems.

During the financial year, we collaborated with a third-party organization to conduct ESG risk assessments for both our suppliers and self-operated factories. The assessment process utilized both selfassessment verification and on-site evaluations to evaluate various ESG issues including business ethics, climate change, environmental impact, and labor management. The assessment was conducted through a sampling approach, covering a total of 145 suppliers including four self-operated factories. The assessment results showed that all suppliers complied with "Code of Conduct for Suppliers of ANTA Sports". We conducted due diligence and assessment focusing on human rights risks such as child labor, discrimination, forced labor, working hours, freedom of association,

collective bargaining and compliance with "Code of Conduct for Suppliers of ANTA Sports". During the assessment, suppliers have relatively low scores in the modules of business ethics, health and safety, and social responsibility. High-risk issues are primarily related to occupational safety, freedom of association and collective bargaining, employee welfare, working hours and wages, and emergency safety. We prioritize empowering and improving the management of these aspects in the supply chain as our focus for ESG efforts, thereby achieving overall enhancement in the supply chain. We commit to monitoring and undergoing periodic assessments of risk fluctuations, promptly adjusting and taking necessary actions to mitigate any adverse effects.

Supply Chain End-to-end Management
We have developed a series of management policies and procedures, including the "Code of Conduct for Suppliers of ANTA Sports", the "Supplier Sustainability Management Handbook", the "Protocol for the Management of Supplier Access and Exit of Apparel and Accessories Suppliers" and the "Protocol for the Management of Supplier Access and Exit of Footwear Suppliers". These clearly define the processes for selection, introduction, auditing, rating, and complaint management applicable to tier 1/2/3 suppliers as well as subcontractors. The systems specify requirements for environmental management and

social responsibility for suppliers and subcontractors, enhancing the efficiency of the entire supply chain management process. We regularly review relevant management systems based on applicable laws, regulations, and customer standards to avoid potential conflicts with ESG requirements. We have also incorporated supply chain risk management into our value chain management process. By conducting supplier sustainability risk assessments, we identify critical suppliers and formulate countermeasures and action plans to ensure the stability of our supply chain.

Admittance Screening
ESG audits are a crucial step for new suppliers entering our system. We have established a systematic supplier screening process, including information collection, preliminary review of information and on-site review. These stages comprehensively assess the supplier's business qualifications, product quality, and other basic information. ESG factors such as health and safety management, environmental protection and labor management are also included in the scope of assessment to ensure that suppliers' supply level, product quality, service capabilities, and their social responsible management performance meet our requirements.

Sustainability is one of the major assessment criteria during supplier screening process. In terms of environment, we focus on our suppliers' waste, wastewater, waste gas and GHG emissions, as well as energy management. On the social front, we review whether suppliers strictly protect the health and safety of the workplace, respect various labor rights, including human rights and the right to freedom of association. In terms of governance, we conduct rigorous assessments of our suppliers to detect any instances of corruption, bribery or other forms of misconduct. Risk factors including country-specific risks, industry-specific risks, and product-specific risks were also involved into supplier screening process, hence to effectively mitigate potential risks and maintain supply chain stability. The identification of our critical suppliers is based on combinative consideration of procurement value, sustainability performance as well as other assessments.

Country-Specific Risks Industry-Specific Risks Product-Specific Risks

This involves evaluating the political stability, legal and regulatory environment, and commercial risks in the countries where suppliers are located.
This involves evaluating the competition levels, technological changes, and shifts in market demand within the industries where suppliers operate.
This involves evaluating potential quality issues, safety risks, environmental responsibilities, and other relevant factors associated with the products supplied by the suppliers.

Information collection
We collect detailed information of our suppliers through the "Collection Form of Supplier Basic Information", including company profile, basic information of the workforce and employee rights, professional qualifications or service capabilities, and relevant operational experience.

Preliminary review of information

On-site review

We conduct preliminary screening of potential suppliers based on their basic information. If zero-tolerance breaches or seriously dishonest behaviors such as use of child labor, forced labor and commercial bribery are detected during the review, the admittance process will be terminated immediately.

We make on-site inspections and professional assessments of suppliers' business premises and practices to check the authenticity of supplier information, formally establish cooperative relationships with qualified suppliers and include the social responsibility performance standards for suppliers into the attachments of the contract to strengthen the standardized requirements for suppliers.

Tiered Management
To improve and optimize the structure of the supply chain, we have adopted a categorized management of the entire supply chain to improve the management efficiency of supply chain operations. Suppliers are classified into tier 1 suppliers, tier 2 suppliers and tier 3 suppliers according to their material categories as well as service relations and other general factors. In addition, suppliers are differentiated into general suppliers or critical suppliers based on material analysis such as procurement volume, risk factors, etc.

Tier 1 suppliers: 267
Suppliers that directly provide finished products (such as garments, finished shoes, finished accessories, etc.), of which 52 are critical suppliers.

Tier 2 suppliers: 370
Registered suppliers, providing materials, components and processes, including fabric, down, lining, leather, soles, auxiliary materials, molds, etc., for tier 1 suppliers. There are 87 critical suppliers in total.

Appraisal and Audit
For suppliers in the cooperation, we adopted a double-axis audit method to conduct annual audits of suppliers'
84 ANTA Sports Products Limited ESG Report 2023

sustainable development status, in accordance with the provisions of the "Code of Conduct for Suppliers of ANTA Sports" and the "Supplier Sustainability Management Handbook". This systematic evaluation assesses

the suppliers' capabilities in terms of quality, delivery, cost for current order execution, alignment with "Code of Conduct for Suppliers of ANTA Sports" as well as their performance in labor management, innovation development, environmental management, and social responsibility.
Through our annual supplier audit, our suppliers are divided into five levels, from the best performing ones to the least performing ones, based on their audit results: extraordinary, excellent, good, to be improved, and red line zone. In accordance with the "Apparel Supplier MIS Performance Appraisal Management Mechanism" and "Footwear Supplier Tiered Grading and Evaluation Management Control Mechanism", we provide corresponding incentives for suppliers at different levels to encourage further improvement and motivate their initiative to fulfill contracts. We require all suppliers to have an ESG audit rating of good or above.

In accordance with the relevant provisions of the "Supplier Sustainability Management Handbook", the Supplier Management Department, in collaboration with our recognized audit organizations, conducts regular ESG audits of suppliers we collaborate with. The results are to identify any violations. Based on the assessment results, we can initiate an upgrade process at any time, specifying remedial and corrective measures as well as follow-up audit methods. This initiative aims to promote the improvement of our suppliers' performance in social responsibility. According to the audit results, some suppliers had violations related with

chemical safety, fire safety, overtime hours, overtime pay and other issues. Based on the results, we provided improvement guidance and assisted the suppliers in making corrective action plan on fire prevention, protection of labor rights and other items, required them to complete the rectification on time, and tracked the progress of rectification. In addition, our suppliers empowerment program also provides continual support to the implementation of suppliers' corrective action plan.
Additionally, we developed the ESG online data collection platform, initiating the collection of ESG

environmental data over 200 suppliers. The data covers GHG emissions, energy consumption, water resource management, wastewater and waste management, etc. We require critical suppliers to conduct SLCP audits and utilize the HIGG FEM as a third-party tool to measure suppliers' environmental performance. Suppliers are required to complete self-assessment and verification within a certain time frame. We also invite suppliers to participate in training courses to help them better understand and apply the assessment tool.

We take appropriate actions upon learning of any violations. We are committed to requiring self-owned operation, supply chain and other partners to conduct regular human rights risk assessment, with the "Labor Policy" and the "Supplier Sustainability Management Handbook" standards as reference to identify the potential risks impacting business operation and supplier management processes.

Safety Management Measures
We consistently prioritize the health and safety of our employees, implementing a multi-layered approach to comprehensively ensure their wellbeing and safety in the workplace.
Safety Prevention and Control
In our "Environmental/Occupational Health and Safety Manual", we stipulate that when identifying environmental factors and hazards, considerations should encompass the design of work areas, processes, installations, machinery or equipment, operating procedures and work organization, as well as human behavior, adaptability and other factors. This approach aims to prevent repetitive strain injuries. To establish a safe working environment, we enhance hazard prevention and control, conducting annual monitoring of occupational hazard factors and completing declarations of occupational hazards in workplaces. Furthermore, we hire a third-party organization every year to perform occupational health inspection in the production area and conduct specialized technical inspection on dust, noise, and other factors to comprehensively identify the occupational hazards in the workplace. Timely and effective preventive and control measures are implemented according to the inspection results to mitigate potential hazard and reduce

risks, hence to ensure employees' occupational health. To strengthen safety management, we arrange daily checks and night inspections, organize monthly inspections on the fire protection system, and regularly maintain production facilities and the use of equipment by our employees to prevent safety incidents. In addition, we have introduced automated equipment to establish a comprehensive system for preventing safety incidents. Through technological means, we continuously improve our safety management standards.

To further emphasize safety awareness, in the vicinity of workplaces, workstations or equipment prone to occupational

disease hazards, we set up warning signs and hazard notification cards with reference to the "Warning Signs for Occupational Hazards in the Workplace" and the "Management Regulations for the Occupational Disease Hazard Notification and Warning Sign of Employers" to remind employees to operate with caution. Additionally, we have established a safety culture promotion gallery to help employees identify and avoid potential occupational health risks.
Safety Emergency Plans
Every year, we formulate an emergency drill plan and organize a variety of safety emergency drills to ensure swift and efficient responses to various safety risks in emergency situations. Through these drills, we can promptly identify and address potential safety hazards, enhance our emergency response capabilities, and ensure the safety and stability of the workplace. For fire safety, we regularly conduct large-scale fire safety drills every year to enhance employees' escape and response capability; for extreme weather conditions such as rainstorm and typhoon, we carry out advance deployment and emergency control, and continuously supplement and improve the safeguard measures according to the situation on the ground to minimize adverse impacts on operations. Additionally, we have formed an emergency response team.

1 We adopted the "Operation Control Method" to compile and convert the environmental data, and did not convert the data of each unit according to shareholding ratio.
2 Emissions (nitrogen oxide, sulphur oxides and particulates) are mainly derived from emissions from the Group's manufacturing companies and emissions from the use of corporate vehicles, of which the calculation of corporate vehicle emissions is based on "How to prepare an ESG Report - Appendix 2: Reporting Guidance on Environmental KPIs" issued by the HKEX. In 2023, we further enhance our statistical capability and improve the statistical coverage of Sulfur oxides compared to 2022, with the addition of Xiamen ANTA Industrial Co., Ltd., resulting in an increase in the Sulfur oxides statistics.
3 Waste water data are obtained from the industrial and domestic waste water of the Group's manufacturing facilities, administrative facilities and logistics facility.
4 Scope 1 GHG emissions are mainly from direct GHG emissions from fossil fuel consumption (such as gasoline, diesel, natural gas, acetylene), refrigerant, carbon dioxide fire extinguishers and septic tank emissions, during operation/production process and the refrigerants emission. The formula used to calculate the main GHG emissions from fossil fuel consumption: CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion = fuel consumption x low level heat generation x carbon content per unit calorific value x fuel carbon oxidation rate x 44/12, while the calculation of refrigerant emissions data refers to "How to prepare an ESG Report - Appendix 2: Reporting Guidance on Environmental KPIs" issued by the HKEX, and the corresponding emission factors refer to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The calculation of septic tank emission data was estimated based on the number of employees and the number of working days per month. In 2023, we have further enhanced our statistical capability compared to 2022 by supplementing the statistics of acetylene, carbon dioxide fire extinguishers and septic tank GHG emissions, which has resulted in an increase in the Scope 1 GHG emissions.
5 Scope 2 GHG emissions are mainly from indirect GHG emissions generated from purchased electricity and steam, purchased cooling and purchased heat consumed in the Group's operation/production process, calculated with reference to "How to prepare an ESG Report - Appendix 2: Reporting Guidance on Environmental KPIs" issued by the HKEX. The electricity emission factor 0.5703 tCO2/MWh for Scope 2 Indirect GHG emissions in 2023 is adopted from "Notice on the management of GHG emission reporting by enterprises in the electricity generation industry from 2023 to 2025" issued by Ministry of Ecology and Environment on 7 February 2023. In 2023, we further enhanced our statistical capabilities compared to 2022 by adding new statistics on purchased cooling and purchased heat GHG emissions. Meanwhile, in 2023, the number of ANTA DTC stores increased due to business expansion, resulting in an increase in purchased electricity and a rise in Scope 2 GHG emissions.

Hazardous waste data are obtained from the disposal volume of hazardous waste of the Group's manufacturing facilities and administrative facilities. In 2023, we further enhanced our statistical capacity compared to 2022 by refining the statistical scope of the total amount of hazardous waste and restating 2022's data. Additionally, we expanded the scope to include Changting ANTA Sports Products Co., Ltd. resulting in an increase in the total amount of hazardous waste. Non-hazardous waste data are obtained from the disposal volume of non-hazardous waste of the Group's manufacturing facilities, administrative facilities and logistics facility. In 2023, we further enhanced our statistical capacity compared to 2022 by refining the statistical scope of the total amount of nonhazardous waste, adding the production waste of Fujian ANTA Logistics Information Technology Co., Ltd. as well as an increase in the total number of employees in 2023, which resulted in an increase in the total amount of non-hazardous waste. Energy consumption is calculated from the consumption of gasoline, diesel, natural gas, purchased electricity, purchased steam, purchased cooling and purchased heat, while the calculation refers to the "General Rules for Calculation of the Comprehensive Energy Consumption" (GB/T 2589-2020). Gasoline energy consumption is mainly derived from the Group's mobile-source gasoline consumption in manufacturing, administrative, logistics and store facilities. In 2023, we have further enhanced our statistical capabilities and improved the scope of our gasoline consumption statistics compared to 2022, with the addition of ANTA (China) Co., Ltd. resulting in an increase in the total gasoline energy consumption. Diesel energy consumption is mainly derived from the Group's fixed-source and mobile-source diesel consumption in the manufacturing, administrative, logistics and store facilities. In 2023, we further enhanced our statistical capability compared to 2022 by refining the statistical coverage of diesel consumption and including Quanzhou Athletic Shoes & Garments Co., Ltd., and Fujian ANTA Logistics Information Technology Co., Ltd., which resulted in an increase in total diesel consumption. The purchased electricity data are obtained from the purchased electricity volume of the Group's manufacturing facilities, administrative facilities, logistics facility and store facilities. The number of ANTA DTC stores increased due to business expansion thus the purchased electricity data in 2023 increased.

14 In 2023 and 2022, the employee turnover rate is calculated based on our latest standards and the 2022 employee turnover rate is adjusted retrospectively. Overall employee turnover rate = number of leaving employees during the financial year/(number of employees at the end of the financial year + number of leaving employees during the financial year) x 100%. Employee turnover rate by category = number of leaving employees of that category during the financial year/(number of employees of that category at the end of the financial year + number of leaving employees of that category during the financial year) x 100%. Employee turnover includes the number of employees who have left (terminated their employment with the Group due to voluntary resignation, dismissal, retirement or death). Our statistics and reporting include all regular employees at all operating locations. The number of employees who left during probationary period is also included. Since both the retail and manufacturing industries are labor-intensive and thus have a higher turnover rate, we will continue to monitor the turnover rate and actively seek improvements.
