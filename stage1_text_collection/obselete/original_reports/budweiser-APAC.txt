About this Report

In Budweiser Brewing Company APAC's (the "Bud APAC") Sustainability Report 2023 (the "Report"), we aim to offer our stakeholders a deeper understanding of our commitment to creating a more sustainable future. This report presents our strategy for identifying and addressing the topics central to our operations. It highlights our achievements in 2023, detailing the governance and policies that shape our decision-making, and emphasizes our commitment to maintaining the utmost standards of ethical business conduct. The Sustainability Report 2023 aligns with our financial reporting across our primary markets: China, South Korea, India, and Vietnam.
In the Report, we integrate non-financial metrics and use guidelines from leading frameworks, including the HKEX Listing Rules Appendix C2 Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting Guide (the "HKEX C2"), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards 2021, the UN Guiding Principles (UNGPs) reporting framework, CDP Water and Climate initiatives, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) standards and the relevant United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).

This Report also includes forward-looking statements which are based on the current insights and expectations of Bud APAC's management, are naturally subject to risks, uncertainties, and potential changes in circumstances. They are not historical facts but rather predictions about future outcomes.
Reporting Period, Scope and Boundary
The scope modification does not influence our 2025 Sustainability Goals, which remain steadfast and applicable. Details regarding the entities encompassed in this reporting scope can be found in the list of fully consolidated subsidiaries, as shown on pages 166 to 167 of the 2023 Annual Report.
The environmental data from newly acquired operations is not included in the running cycle and will be incorporated in future reports. However, safety data is an exception: it is immediately tracked, monitored, and included for all sites, unless specified otherwise in the text or footnotes. End-of-year incident data is collected in mid-January of the subsequent year and validated based on information from

that point in time, as injury statuses may change due to further medical evaluations or treatments. This can ensure a consistent and accurate year-over-year comparison. Any reclassification of injuries in subsequent years does not alter the current year's report or affect the comparative data of previous years.
Our Sustainability Goals, including metrics on water, energy, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, cover both our beverage and vertical operations, unless stated otherwise. Energy usage figures reported exclude energy exported to third parties and some ongoing projects, not reflecting the total energy utilised in our beer production. In our beverage and vertical operations, including malting and packaging, we employ the Voyager Plant Optimisation (VPO) system. The key performance indicators - energy usage, water usage, and Scope 1 and 2 emissions per hectoliter of production - are reported exclusively for beverage operations, as per our annual CDP disclosure. Additional details and specifications are provided in footnotes accompanying specific data tables.

Appendices

Operations classified as Special Operations, due to factors such as reduced volume, low full-time equivalent count, complexity of brand mix, or unique products and processes, are not included in the reporting scope. The assumptions for calculating environmental impact percentages include: 1) the country's average Scope 1 and 2 emissions per hectoliter, 2) average production volume per country, 3) for experimental centers, CO2 tonnage applied akin to that of the smaller facilities, and 4) for standard operating procedures in verticalized operations, emission averages from larger sites are used.
Materiality and Reporting Structure
This Report delves into how Bud APAC manages and responds to sustainabilityrelated matters critical to both our business and our stakeholders. The structure of the Report is designed to correspond with our strategic sustainability priorities, underpinning the reporting principles and criteria set by the previously mentioned guidelines and standards. A comprehensive materiality analysis was undertaken to pinpoint the sustainability issues of greatest significance to our stakeholders in various regions. This analysis was instrumental in shaping the Report's content.
To view our Materiality Assessment, please see page 12.

Our Reporting Content Index, which encompasses the GRI Index, the HKEX C2 and the UN Global Compact, can be found on pages 91 to 96.
To provide a comprehensive picture of our sustainability management and performance, we also refer to and align with key ESG ratings and frameworks such as MSCI, Sustainalytics, Dow Jones Sustainability Index (the "DJSI"), the CDP Climate Change Questionnaire, the CDP Water Security Questionnaire and climaterelated disclosures as per the TCFD recommended framework.
The contents of this Report have received approval from our Sustainability Committee and were later approved by the Board on March 18th, 2024. Key data within this report has undergone limited assurance by KPMG to ensure its accuracy and reliability. Further insights into our sustainability initiatives, including past reports, performances, policies, and responses to the CDP Climate Change and Water Security Questionnaires, can be accessed on our official website.

Co-Chairs' Statement

Looking back on 2023, we have made significant strides towards achieving our 2025 Sustainability Goals through pioneering industry-first innovations. Our 2025 Sustainability Goals refer to climate action, water stewardship, circular packaging, and sustainable agriculture, which are interlinked and instrumental to our overall business strategy in achieving positive environmental impact and creating value for our communities. Encouraged by our sustainability progress, we deepened our commitment by sharing our ambition to achieve net zero across our value chain by 2040.
We believe Sustainability not only better aligns with our overarching purpose "We dream big to create a future with more cheers", but also helps drive us from commitment to action, and from declaration to delivery. We enhanced our governance by assessing the resilience of our business through a comprehensive risk scenario analysis. Together, these efforts better enable us and our business partners to develop actionable transition plans.

The journey is best when it's shared
Recognizing our role as a catalyst for economic growth, job creation, and sustainable development as Asia's largest brewer, we understand that the beer sector plays a critical role in supporting local economies. The production, distribution, and consumption of beers are inherently local activities, making the industry integral to businesses and communities across the value chain. Oxford Economics' research on the beer industry's economic impact shows that 1 in every 110 jobs in the world is linked - through direct, indirect, or induced channel to the beer sector. Collaboration is paramount for sustainability - both within our organizational boundaries and beyond. We actively engage with our suppliers and the key stakeholders to generate positive impact in our community.

At Bud APAC, we believe that sustainability enables our commercial vision, unlocks longterm value, and fulfills our company purpose.

We have a large number of value chain partners who account for 94% of our total carbon emission profile. To jointly address this large part of our carbon footprint, we have designed a specialized program to support our partners in their transition towards low-carbon practices and improved water efficiency. We initiated a monthly carbon emission reporting system for all upstream and downstream suppliers, marking the first step towards accurate data collection. Collaborating closely with tier-one suppliers, we have supported the setting of targets that align with the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) as well as aiding in the formulation of carbon emission reduction roadmaps

and the enhancement of water footprint management.
You might be curious about our choice of photograph this year featuring both of us with lime farmers. We take pride in sharing the remarkable journey of "Corona Extra Lime", evolving from a rural revitalization initiative into a dynamic social enterprise business model. We support local farmers to cultivate premium quality limes and improve their livelihood. This initiative not only enhances the beer drinking experience for consumers by adding fresh lime to Corona beers but also contributes to the well-being of lime farmers in Sichuan, China. Furthermore, we extended our support by facilitating the sale of

these limes through our wholesaler and retailer networks, offering consumers the opportunity to purchase these premium limes.
Manifesting a more sustainable future
We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the driving forces behind our sustainability journey - our dedicated employees, our value chain partners, and all those who have steadfastly supported our endeavours. As we embark on the 2024 sustainability journey, our commitment deepens, and we persist in embracing three pivotal cross-cutting themes: inclusive, natural and local.

Thank you for being a crucial part of our journey, and we look forward to achieving more milestones together in the years to come.

I am proud that our team remains focused on what we do best: brewing high-quality beers, actively engaging with consumers, supporting our partners, and making a positive impact on the communities that we serve.

About Bud APAC

Governance Structure
At Bud APAC, we have a robust governance structure to ensure proper oversight by the Board of Directors. As the ultimate strategic and decision-making body, the Board of Directors (Board), is responsible for harmonising the corporate ethos with the Company's mission, values, and strategic direction, and ensuring a cohesive link between corporate governance and sustainability.
The Board Committees - which include the Nomination Committee, the Remuneration Committee, and the Audit and Risk Committee - are primarily composed of Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs). These committees supervise the business, operational, and financial aspects of Bud APAC with support from the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee handles Bud APAC's everyday operations and puts the Board's directives into action. It also steers the Management Committees, comprising Sustainability, Risk and Ethics and Compliance Committees, to adhere to the company's values and Sustainability Goals. This wellstructured governance framework allows for the formulation of initiatives and action plans at the management level, which are then communicated to our sustainability champions and target owners, and ultimately to all of our employees.
For more information on our corporate governance, please refer to the Corporate Governance Report on pages 23 to 59 of our Annual Report 2023.

Governance Structure

Management Committees

The Independent Non-Executive Directors make up over one-third of the Board of Directors. Throughout the reporting period, apart from the professional relationships inherent to their roles, there are no significant connections (financial, business, familial or other relevant ties) among the Directors. Detailed biographies of the Directors can be found in the "Corporate Governance Report - Board of Directors" section of the Annual Report 2023 on pages 27 to 37.

In the reporting period, Bud APAC held 4 Board meetings, 8 Board Committee meetings, and 1 Annual General Meeting (AGM). Each of the Board of Directors undertook over 15 hours of professional training, including those focused on sustainability. Details of the training and meeting attendance of the Directors are available on page 38 in the 2023 Annual Report.

A diverse and balanced Board which is rich in varied skills and experiences can bring multiple perspectives and enhance the Board's ability to effectively fulfil its duties and responsibilities. Our Board Diversity Policy outlines our commitment to achieving diversity and balance on the Board. The Nomination Committee annually reviews the Board's composition and also reviews measurable diversity objectives and targets when evaluating the Board's effectiveness. Board appointment criteria

availability. As water becomes scarcer in various regions, we may face risks in sourcing other critical natural ingredients.
Our reliance on agricultural commodities such as barley, hops, rice, corn, wheat and various fruits makes us susceptible to weather fluctuations, droughts, and plant diseases.

Our Policy
Please refer to our publicly available Climate Policy for more information about our position and strategies regarding climate action.
Our Vision and Ambition
We have the ambition to reach net zero across our value chain by 2040, with

an interim target of achieving 100% renewable electricity within operation and reducing GHG emission intensity by 25% across our value chain by 2025, aligned with our Science-Based Target. This ambition prioritizes the reduction of GHG emissions from our operations as well as across our value chain and allows us to prioritize climate-related risks and identify opportunities that are significant to us.

Our Approach
Equipped with a comprehensive understanding of our GHG emissions throughout the value chain, we have developed a decarbonization plan that identifies key reduction opportunities, including:
 Enhancing operational and energy efficiency at the brewery level through the adoption of advanced technologies to minimize GHG emissions;
 Incorporating low-carbon energy sources throughout our operations and value chain;
 Encouraging energy-efficient and low-emission practices among our value chain partners, particularly strategic suppliers for packaging and raw materials, as well as logistic partners;
 Supporting our suppliers to build their carbon baseline and decarbonization roadmap, we facilitated carbon footprint mapping for 40 suppliers and 90 sites.
 Promoting circularity initiatives to mitigate GHG emissions originating from packaging and waste;
 Pioneering innovative cooling solutions as alternatives to conventional refrigerants;
 Exploring nature-based solutions to eliminate any remaining GHG emissions; and
 Collaborating with industry stakeholders, policymakers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other key actors to foster innovation and drive progress.

Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures
We have assessed our business operations using the guidelines set forth by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to communicate climate change-related risks and opportunities for 2023. We have included our assets in the assessment of both physical and transition risks and aligned our decarbonization targets with a 1.5캜 emission reduction pathway. We are also looking to turn our climate-related risks into opportunities through risk adaptation and mitigation. With the IFRS Foundation taking over the TCFD's monitoring responsibilities as of January 2024, we acknowledged the ISSB standards continue to pave the way for global sustainability reporting, we will adapt the newest available standard for our future reporting.

With our detailed climate risk assessment, we want to highlight our efforts to reduce our contribution to climate change, our initial analysis of the relationship between climate impact and our business; and our actions when responding to identifying risks and opportunities arising from a changing climate.

The climate risk assessment follows the four elements of the TCFD framework whereas in this section we focus on the risk management element, with the additional elements covered in other sections of this report.

Case Study: Further Decarbonization in Our Brewery with Industry-first Electric Boiler Installation
Our Ziyang Brewery in Sichuan, China became the China beer industry's first to install electric boilers using hydropower in 2023. The electric boilers replaced the natural gas ones to generate steam with a newly constructed power generation and storage system. Leveraging the peak-valley power pricing to achieve cost-effectiveness, the system generates and stores the heat by the off-peak hours electricity (the price is 72% lower than peak hours) to meet the brewery's steam production needs throughout the day.
In addition to the power cost-effectiveness, we strategically took a sustainable project model, "Energy as a Service (EaaS)", to capture the transition opportunity with financial benefits. We have formed a partnership with the selected service provider for a 20-year procurement contract who invested approximately RMB40 million in the infrastructure and equipment for the whole system, with a building area of around 3,000 square meters within Ziyang Brewery.
The project includes the construction of a new 25 MW electric steam boiler, two 1,000 m high-pressure energy storage tanks with a daily steam supply capacity of 250 tons, a new 25.5 MW high-voltage distribution system, a new purified water system, and an intelligent energy management platform. The project is expected to realise a reduction of approximately 7,000 tons of CO2 emissions.

Water Withdrawals
Water Consumption1/ Water Usage2

To produce our beverages, our breweries source water from various providers,



including third-party water utilities, groundwater, and surface water. However,

water withdrawal for the purpose of exporting to third parties is not included in  our reporting scope, as it is not utilized by our own operations within the breweries

under consideration.

Agriculture (Supply Chain):



Water is utilized in agricultural processes for the agricultural products we procure, however, it is not included in our water consumption or usage data as it falls outside  the reporting scope for brewery operations.

Conversion of Brewing Ingredients (Supply Chain):

Our suppliers require water to convert raw materials and agricultural produce into ingredients for our products. For instance, the conversion of barley into malt necessitates water. Nevertheless, this particular process is not accounted for in our water consumption or usage data as it lies beyond the reporting scope for brewery operations.

Local communities
Water utilities

Water withdrawal is quantified and documented on a monthly basis for all sites, irrespective of the water source. This measurement and reporting process is aligned with crucial production levels and conducted on an eight-hour per shift basis, allowing for continuous benchmarking and necessary corrective actions. Additionally, water withdrawals are reported for each individual site based on the specific water sources utilized.

Our farmers We perform water risk assessments at all of our breweries including (supply chain) the ones in water-stressed regions.

Our production and operations

Our objective is to decrease overall water consumption by implementing enhancements in water usage efficiency. Annually, we expand the number of facilities that reuse reclaimed water. Furthermore, newly established beverage operations adhere to strict guidelines for increased levels of reclaimed water reuse.

We ensure the provision of fully operational and secure WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) services to all workers.

Brewing Operations (Our Operation): Water is consumed in our breweries for production and operational purposes. Sanitary Water Use (Our Operation): Within our breweries, we provide clean water for workers' handwashing, toilet flushing and showering.

End of Life (Our Operation):
As part of the water treatment process, some wastewater is evaporated into the atmosphere before entering the biological treatment system. During this phase, water is lost and considered as part of our consumption.

1 Water consumption includes water contained in our final product and water loss from evaporation before treatment. 2 Water usage includes water consumption (see the footnote above) and water being reused in operation.

Actions
Water Withdrawal
Water Withdrawal and Risk Assessment With reference to the World Resources Institute's ("WRI") Aqueduct tool and our internal custom-made water risk tool, we conduct a comprehensive seven-step watershed management process at breweries located in water-stressed areas annually and quarterly to classify each brewery from "Very High-Risk" to "Low to Medium Risk" sites. We also monitor the supply chain and apply the WRI Aqueduct tool to ensure that our agricultural raw materials do not come from areas with water scarcity or where water scarcity is expected.
Impact Update water risk mapping among our breweries. Five of our breweries in India are located in three high water stress areas, this represents 3.8% of total volume of company-wide breweries across APAC.
Water Consumption/Usage
Water Management Due Diligence on Suppliers To assess the water stewardship practices of our suppliers and gather valuable insights for designing a comprehensive water value chain engagement program, we have implemented a structured working procedure. This procedure involves evaluating 14 supplier sites through various measures. Firstly, we conduct Water Risk Assessments using Aqueduct to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities. Additionally, we evaluate the Water Consumption Rate through Water Balance calculations to gain a better understanding of water usage patterns. To further enhance our evaluation process, we benchmark the suppliers' practices against industry best practices using a Scorecard approach. To improve awareness and knowledge, we have launched online webinars focusing on water risk assessment and emergency response planning. We encourage the development of robust water strategies and management plans, including initiatives for water reuse and recycling. In line with our commitment to sustainable water management, we expect all suppliers to establish effective water targets, which we will diligently track on an annual basis.
Impact Raise water efficiency awareness among suppliers with improved value chain water management.

Water Discharge
Monitoring of Quality and Quantity of Wastewater Discharge in India
We have implemented various methods to enhance water efficiency within our breweries through a rigorous water management program. This program includes the adoption of advanced technologies such as Electro Dialysis Reversal, Multi-Effect Evaporators, and Wastewater recovery plants, which enable us to achieve Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD). At two of our breweries in India, we have successfully implemented ZLD strategies, incorporating cutting-edge water treatment facilities with Reverse Osmosis (RO) systems. These installations allow for efficient water recycling and on-site utilization for various purposes. Notably, these two breweries have achieved 100% ZLD and one of them is in high water risk area. In addition, we have implemented VPO to drive efficiencies at our plants. This continuous audit process enables us to improve the water discharge in all our plant operations, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization.
Impact
Two breweries in India have achieved 100% Zero Liquid Discharge in their brewing operations.
Creating Water Recharge Capacities for Water-Stressed Areas in India
We replenished approximately two times (199%) of the water to the water-stressed areas in India, which is very close to our target "replenished two time water in the high water-stressed areas compared to our consumption" by 2025. To improve water use efficiency, we collaborate with farmers and employ technologies such as low-elevation sprinklers, drip irrigation and precision and variable rate irrigation systems. These efforts benefit both the watershed and the farmers, leading to improved crop yield and quality, optimized land use and reduced risks in crop investments. In partnership with organizations such as Water Aid and Samhita, we work towards water conservation and enhancing water access and security in water stressed villages near our operational areas. In 2023, we worked with our partners on water-demand management through training and awareness sessions. These activities aim to improve water availability and accessibility for the communities we serve. We will continue with our efforts to support the waterstressed areas with more investment and tailored solutions to align with our water stewardship strategy.
Impact
Water replenishment rate reached 199% in water-stressed areas in India.

Case Study: Water Supply Chain Management - Improving Water Efficiency and Quality within and beyond Our Brewery Operations
In our water stewardship initiatives, we have undertaken diverse projects to improve water management and sustainability, especially in the high-water risk areas in India. These efforts include commissioning and installing an ultrafiltration system, alongside implementing a Reverse Osmosis (RO) system for further treatment. Progress has also been made in improving weak wort recovery and achieving stability at the biological treatment system (BTS) facility. To optimize resource use, we have successfully integrated hot water recovery from the brewhouse and adjusted bottle washer nozzle sizes to enhance water efficiency. Furthermore, automation of the brewhouse CleaningIn-Place (CIP) process using a conductivity meter ensures precise and efficient cleaning. Waste reduction and resource conservation efforts include trub recovery and water push techniques. Additionally, a system has been implemented to enable flushing water recovery for reuse in our belt press operations. These initiatives collectively underscore our commitment to sustainable water management, resulting in significant reductions in water consumption across various operational domains. It is notable that we have five breweries in three high water risk areas and one of them achieved 2.0 hl/hl water usage for beer brewing in 2023.
Beyond operational enhancement, Bud APAC, in collaboration with WaterAid India, has extended its focus to community water access as part of a holistic water supply chain management approach. Our partnership revolves around implementing our 7-step Watershed Management Process and our innovative solution - constructing soak pits surrounding borewells. These pits efficiently collect surface run-off water, replenishing groundwater and mitigating water scarcity challenges. Consequently, farmers benefit from preserved farmland, alleviating the burden of inadequate water supply. Additionally, WaterAid India and Bud APAC are assisting farmers in installing sprinklers to promote efficient crop irrigation, minimizing water wastage and fostering sustainable farming practices. This holistic approach to water supply chain management underscores our dedication to enhancing water efficiency and quality both within and beyond our brewery operations.

Our Vision and Ambition
We are working to ensure that Bud APAC's business will continue to grow sustainably over the next 100+ years. In doing so, it is critical to maintain crucial ecosystem services and the availability of raw materials such as barley, hops and water, as our production and operations are highly dependent on them.

Our Approach
Our ambition to achieve net zero across our value chain in 2040 encompasses a range of strategies aimed at safeguarding biodiversity, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting restoration efforts. Drawing from the insights gained through our regenerative agriculture program, sustainable sourcing practices, and water stewardship initiatives, we are actively integrating biodiversity considerations into our operations. We have a specific focus on identifying, measuring, and monitoring the impacts on biodiversity throughout our value chain. We are actively developing a comprehensive soil health framework to assist our farmers and encourage biodiversity, enhance water quality, and sequester greenhouse gas emissions. By equipping our farmers with the necessary practices and tools to assess and enhance soil quality, we aim to foster a stronger connection with them, enabling us to gather valuable insights and provide personalized

recommendations. Action items of our soil management are as follows:
 Conduct comprehensive soil assessments to evaluate naturerelated risks and understand the impacts and dependencies on natural resources that are significant to Bud APAC's operations and supply chain.
 Refrain from sourcing ingredients or operating in areas designated as World Heritage Sites and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Category I-IV Protected Areas.
 Promote ecosystem restoration by implementing local regenerative practices, providing education to farmers in our supply chain, and optimizing our operations to minimize adverse effects on the environment and biodiversity.
 Minimize habitat disturbance, degradation, and indirect impacts such as pollution and atmospheric emissions from our operations and supply chain.
 Enhance awareness of biodiversity among stakeholders, especially employees and local communities.

Biodiversity Opportunities
Soil Health Framework in India Soil health is the foundation for ensuring sustainable productivity of barley and other crops, which is critical to maintaining food security and ultimately social stability. We recognize the importance of soil health and are building a holistic soil health framework to support our farmers, promote biodiversity and water quality, and sequester carbon. As we provide our farmers with the practices and tools they need to understand and improve the quality of their soils, it is important that we stay in touch with them to effectively gather evidence and provide recommendations for additional action.

Smart Agriculture Opportunities
Digitalization and Agricultural Technology
100% of our direct farmers in India are registered on the digital platform KisanHub. The platform allows our field team to record data digitally, as well as deploy real-time crop management protocols among farmers to make informed decisions. In addition, we use quality assurance technologies to ensure that the barley purchased from our farmers meets our quality requirements.

Impact We have expanded coverage of the Soil Health Framework to 86% of our farmers in India.

Impact In 2023, 100% of the barley procured from our farmers met the quality specifications.

Resource Efficient and Low Carbon Farming Opportunities Regenerative Barley Farming We collaborated with Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Reclamation and Development to revitalize domestic barley cultivation in 2023. Using a patented technology on lowcarbon regenerative barley farming, we aimed to enhance soil carbon sequestration and achieve sustainable agriculture. The technology transforms food processing by-products into biodegradable agricultural materials which could potentially improve soil quality and facilitate carbon sequestration.
Impact This project enhances soil carbon sequestration capacity and achieves sustainable agricultural development through soil health management and reducing the use of fertilizer and pesticide.

Indoor Hops Farming Project To reduce costs, and our carbon footprint, and streamline our supply chain, we have begun cultivating Cascade hops indoors in China. By growing hops indoors, we can maintain consistent quality and have greater control over the cultivation process. Furthermore, we aim to develop large-scale, sustainable initiatives for long-term production.
Our hop cultivation in a Chinese greenhouse has yielded positive outcomes. By utilizing this method, we have achieved resource savings, including an 80% reduction in water usage, a 90% reduction in land requirements, and a 95% reduction in fuel consumption for transportation. Moving forward, we plan to expand this program and venturing into innovative concepts such as utilizing soils derived from spent grains, as well as conducting flavor experiments.
Impact
In 2023, we achieved a yield of 1,000 kg/ha of Cascade hop.

Action Innovative Product Design
Vegatex utilizes its patented technology to upcycle food waste and by-products, including spent grain and fruit waste. Their innovative process extracts food-grade protein powder and transforms the remaining materials into vegan leather, suitable for various industries such as textiles, leather, and chemicals. Vegatex achieved a successful collaboration with the Bud team, resulting in the development of BarleySkin. This environmentally friendly leather alternative minimizes the environmental impact by replacing fossil-derived materials with Bud China's supplied spent grain (BSG) through Vegatex's patented process. In 2023, in collaboration with Bud China's local brand, Sedrin, BarleySkin leather fashion outfits were showcased at the 2023 London Fashion Week, highlighting the limitless possibilities of this eco-friendly fashion material. Over the past two years, the partnership between Vegatex and Bud China has continued to foster innovation.
Digital Solutions for Decarbonization
Carbonebook offers comprehensive and professional digital transformation solutions to help customers achieve net zero. Through their digital system, Carbonebook assisted Bud China in collecting carbon emissions data from upstream suppliers and seamlessly integrating carbon management systems into their daily operations, thereby accelerating the reduction of their carbon emissions. With Bud China's leadership and Carbonebook's expertise, this collaborative effort is expected to help Bud China achieve its climate goals. In 2024, Carbonebook will scale to APAC with the support from Bud APAC team.

Impact In 2023, Vegatex incorporated 10% BSG and 26% biobased materials into a cell phone case for a global electronics brand. Moreover, Vegatex has been developing BarleySkin as a material for car interiors and is currently undergoing various safety tests in preparation for commercialization.
Impact Following a successful pilot program with three suppliers in 2022, Bud China expanded its partnership with Carbonebook in 2023 to include 37 suppliers and 86 sites, encompassing approximately 40% of the carbon emissions footprint across Bud China's entire value chain.

Actions
Occupational Safety Control
CCTV AI Detection We are continuously exploring how to utilize AI technology to capture and identify unsafe behaviors, providing early warnings and preventing accidents even before they occur. We have selected Suqian Brewery as a pilot project. The High-altitude Intelligent AI Recognition project at Suqian Brewery utilizes on-site AI recognition cameras to collect data. Through local video analysis servers and AI video analysis technology, the system automatically monitors and analyzes non-compliance behaviors such as failure to wear safety belts or failure to hook properly. When violations are detected, alarm signals are sent to on-site audio-visual devices for reminders, and the alarm records are uploaded to cloud servers.
Proactive Safety Management Employees are encouraged to conduct self-assessments to proactively identify potential risks in their respective areas. We optimize processes and consider eliminating operations that could lead to hazards. In cases where operations cannot be eliminated, we explore process optimization, changes in work methods, or reduction in frequency to minimize associated risks. We also adopt a proactive approach by learning from near-miss incidents, which are events that could have resulted in an accident. We engage all relevant personnel, including operators, engineers, and safety managers, in conducting in-depth analyses to identify the root causes. Based on the priority of control measures, we develop action plans that prioritize the elimination of hazards at their source. The safety management of the sales team includes regular safety trainings covering road safety and hazard prevention such as accidents, theft and extreme weathers.
Building Safety Culture
2023 World Safety Day Every year, we celebrate World Safety Day and organize various activities to improve the safety awareness and knowledge of our employees and contractors. We held the World Safety Week in the week of 24 April 2023 and organized activities around 8 main safety topics. We promoted safety awareness in road safety, fire safety, first aid skills, self-rescue and food safety, etc.

Impacts Management personnel can access real-time analysis results through the system interface, enabling prompt problem identification, enhanced safety, and improved management efficiency.
Impacts To ensure a proactive approach to safety, we have organized over 100 joint meetings to deeply investigate incidents, leading to the generation of more than forty safety alerts. These alerts serve to share valuable insights and lessons learned, with the goal of preventing similar incidents from occurring again.
Impacts The event had involved 32,130 participants, 11,131 contractors and executed 784 initiatives (+9.5% compared to 2022).

Case Study: Digital Safety Transformation (DST)
Digital safety transformation can accurately extract safety performance indicators and construct a set of system for estimating people risks (Safety Code) and Environmental Risks (Five-color Risk Map). It can also simplify, visualize, and real-time respond to safety management risks. It accelerates safety culture building via effective positive/ negative consequences management.
Intelligence: hundreds of risk databases are embedded in the system to intelligently identify workplace-related risks and publish them in the APP and on the website.
Visibility: the multidimensional dashboard helps all levels better understand the situation on-site. We set up the dashboard for zone level, function level and brewery level to visualize the safety data on the dashboard.
Reward: our employees can earn safety points and medals when they report unsafe behavior. There are 21 types of medals in DST, mainly to encourage employees to report unsafe behaviors and conditions and to use SAFE to conduct risk assessments before non-routine work and to monitor high-risk activities.
The Data Safety Tracking system is available for use by all employees and contractors. In China, the DST system collects nearly 150,000 data points per day. By leveraging the use of Power BI, we conduct data analysis to identify areas of weakness in brewery safety management and facilitate improvements. Furthermore, we have also expanded the promotion of the DST system to other countries in the APAC region, including South Korea, India, and Vietnam. We are committed to continuously updating and enhancing the DST system to make it even more effective in supporting Environment, Health, and Safety management.

Case Study: Zone Talent Induction & Business@ABI
Our 2023 Zone Talent Induction brought all APAC talent program participants together to the Putian Brewery to learn about the strategic directions of Bud APAC. 80 new talents across five APAC talent programs were invited. It was a full week of training for the new talent program joiners to understand our strategies:
 Lead and Grow the Category,
 Digitize & Monetize our Ecosystem, and
 Optimize our Business.
The joiners also had opportunities to visit the brewery, take part in a sports competition, market visits and a beer festival. Overall, we created a memorable experience for the new joiners to kick-start the career at Bud APAC.
Business@ABI is the flagship development program aimed at developing our future senior leaders within BUD APAC. The core objective of this initiative is to stimulate and elevate the capabilities and mindsets of APAC leaders, including aspects such as Leadership Effectiveness, Business Acumen, Strategic Thinking, and the cultivation of future-ready skills.
Together with the academic study provided by CEIBS professors, our program incorporates action learning methodologies. Participants engage in setting group topics aligned with business goals, experimenting with their plans to achieve results. This includes in-depth discussions on development strategy, best practices, innovative operations, digitalization and fostering a holistic and dynamic learning environment.

Actions
We declared Inclusion Month in October, during which we conducted various activities across APAC, from hosting events to trainings, to reflecting on our D&I journey, celebrating our progress, and reaffirming our commitment to making Bud APAC a place where everyone can be their authentic selves. During the month, we arranged online learning program and Inclusion trainings in China and Vietnam. We hosted a fireside chat with global female leaders in India. We have also arranged various trainings and activities to engage employees as well as their families.

Empowered Future
Mulan Mentoring Program

The Mulan mentoring program is designed to expedite the professional and personal development of women, preparing them as potential successors for important leadership positions, and fostering a more diverse and robust talent pool. The initial phase of the program welcomed participation from women employees in China who held managerial positions or higher, allowing them to enrol as either mentors or mentees. Throughout the program, mentees and mentors took part in a series of training sessions and interactive exchanges, facilitating their growth and progress along the mentoring journey.

Female Brewmaster

Our training and certification program for female brewmasters started from 2011. Over the past 13 years, 24 female employees have successfully obtained the brewmaster certification. One of them founded the 059 Coastline Craft beer brand, by using traditional brewing techniques and locally sourced ingredients from Fujian Province to produce distinctive fruit-flavoured craft beers. It currently stands as one of the best-selling brands in Fujian local craft beer market.

Equitable Future Gender Pay Equity

We work with an independent partner to conduct a comprehensive pay equity review annually. In 2023, we confirmed there was no statistically significant differences in base pay between women and men across Bud APAC.

Case Study: "Stand Tall" - India Women Leadership Development Program
"Stand Tall" is the Women Leadership Development Program for the India BU created with the intent to empower women talent with an experiential and impactful learning journey to develop crucial leadership and functional competencies, thereby creating a strong pipeline of women leaders for the organization. It is a platform that enables participants to overcome their personal and professional challenges, recognize and leverage the strengths that they bring to their roles and ultimately take charge of their careers and create a personal brand for themselves.
35 female talents from across functions and locations in India joined "Stand Tall" in an eight-month long journey. This involved experiential workshops on key skills such as assertiveness, personal branding and networking. To offer comprehensive development, we had sessions with the company leadership team to build cross-functional know-how and offer face time with the leaders to hear about their journey. The program ended with one-to-one mentoring with leaders in the organization to enable the participants with support and guidance on how to navigate their personal and professional goals.

Action
Corona Extra Lime Project
Since 2019, Bud China initiated the "Corona Extra Lime" project to support farmers in Anyue of Sichuan province to cultivate high quality limes, which not only improves farmers' livelihood, but also enhances consumers' corona-drinking experience. In 2023, Bud China further developed the project to create a social enterprise business model to accelerate and expand impact by establishing the Extra Lime Company with the provision of start-up capital, project investment and operation guidance. This is a model involving different parties and incorporated with various components. More than just securing the lime supply for Corona, this pioneering initiative can further promote the development of the lime industry and help improve the income for farmers in a sustainable way. The Extra Lime Company has signed an agreement with Bud China, to give priority to hiring farmers from low-income families and pledged to reinvest 20% of the net profits in the village. These funds will be utilized to support underprivileged community members and catalyze industrial development.

Impact

Happy Library - Renewing Old Community Child Centers
In South Korea, we have started a local community project to renovate learning facilities and provide free educational materials and books for underprivileged community since 2016. This year, we opened the 11th Happy Library at the community center in Gangneung City, which was severely affected by a large-scale forest fire. On the day of opening ceremony, sales employees volunteered to organize books and paint mural outside of the community child center.

The lime base has expanded from 30 MU in 2020 to 478 MU in 2023, with accumulated 740,000 kg of limes sold.
Impact

We have donated 4,200 books to local libraries over the past 7 years.

Reporting Methodology

Environmental data



Data pertaining to the environment

from our recently acquired

operations is not included in the

current reporting period but will be

incorporated in subsequent reports.



The reported energy consumption

and procurement figures exclude

energy that is sold to external

entities and the energy used in

certain ongoing construction

projects. This excluded energy

consumption is not part of the

amount of energy consumed in our

beer brewing process.



Our reporting on renewable

electricity usage is based on the

renewable electricity we have

contracted. This measure reflects

our commitments towards achieving

our goal of using 100% renewable

electricity.



To calculate the recycled content

in our products, we use a weighted

average method, considering each

supplier's purchases and the

recycled content in their materials.

Our focus on primary packaging,

which constitutes over 83% of our

global packaging volume by weight,

is a part of our broader initiatives in promoting circularity, which also includes secondary packaging and managing post-consumer waste.



For non-returnable packaging, such

as one-way glass bottles, aluminum

cans, and PET bottles, our objective

is to ensure a minimum of 50%

recycled content.



The percentage of recycled content

is sourced from our suppliers and is

consistently monitored. Packaging

purchase data is derived from our

internal procurement system. Since

2019, we have initiated supplier

audits to verify the accuracy of

recycled content data.



The water replenishment rate

equals the total potential

water replenished in 2023 to

the community through the

infrastructure investment and

other efforts cumulative from 2020

to 2023 divided by the total water

consumption of the three breweries

(namely PALS, CBL, and Crown

Beers Breweries) in high-risk area

in 2023. These three breweries

have been identified as part of the

global 2025 sustainability water

stewardship goals.

Social data



Safety data for all locations is

immediately collected and analyzed

and is included in the Report

unless specified differently in the

text or footnotes. Incident data at

the end of the year is gathered in

mid-January of the subsequent

year for validation. It is important to

note that injury classifications may

evolve based on further medical

assessments and treatments,

affecting their status. This approach

allows for a consistent and

accurate comparison of data at a

fixed annual point. Any revisions in

injury classification in subsequent

years do not alter the reporting

for the current year or affect the

comparison with past data.



Data on workforce diversity and

composition are recorded at the

close of FY23.

Our assurance was with respect to the year ended 31 December 2023 information only and we have not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods or any other elements included in the 2023 Sustainability Report and, therefore, do not express any conclusion thereon.

Criteria
The criteria used by the Company to prepare the Selected Sustainability Information is set out in the "Reporting Methodology" section on page 81 of the 2023 Sustainability Report (the "Criteria").

The Company's Responsibility
for the Selected Sustainability
Information
The Company is responsible for the preparation of the Selected Sustainability Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation of the Selected Sustainability Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Content Index for Reporting Guidelines Glossary
Inherent Limitations
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities. In addition, GHG quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gases.
Our Independence and Quality
Control
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.
Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements , issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). This standard requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system

of quality management, including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Our Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Selected Sustainability Information based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. This report is made solely to you, as a body, in accordance with our agreed terms of engagement, and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of this report.
We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, and, in respect of greenhouse gas emissions, International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, issued by the IAASB. These standards require that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Selected Sustainability Information is free from material misstatement.

A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company's use the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Selected Sustainability Information, assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Selected Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation of the Selected Sustainability Information. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgement and included inquiries, observation of processes performed, inspection of documents, analytical procedures, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies, and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.

Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above we:

-

Made inquiries of the relevant

staff responsible for the Selected

Sustainability Information;

-

Understood the process for

collecting and reporting the

Selected Sustainability Information;

-

Compared the Selected

Sustainability to underlying

information sources on a sample

basis;

-

Performed analytical procedures

over the Selected Sustainability

Information; and

-

Considered the disclosure and

presentation of the Selected

Sustainability Information.

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the Company's Selected Sustainability Information has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.

Content Index for Reporting Guidelines Glossary
Conclusion
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Company's Selected Sustainability Information for the year ended 31 December 2023 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.
