ABOUT THIS REPORT FUNDAMENTALS EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATIONPRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORKINTRODUCTIONINTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATIONPRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE 01 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 2021 was a stark reminder of the urgent need for us all to move towards a more sustainable way of living. COVID-19 and its effects remained per - vasive and we felt the increasingly devastating impact of climate change, which threatens biodiversity, ecosystems, natural balance, resources and livelihoods around the world. The businesses worldwide were also tested by numerous challenges, including the cost of raw materials, logistics disruption and the supply shortage of semiconductors. All of these point to the precipice upon which we now stand, and it is time to decide Do we continue as before, allowing our environment to succumb to the damage we are inflicting upon it, or do we take decisive actions now, to ensure that there will still be a habita - ble home for our future generations? No Premium Without Sustainability As societies work towards a more sustainable economy, businesses also need to keep up with the sustainable development. The sustainability tar - gets of BMW Brilliance are aligned with BMW Group, and we fully support the Group s strategic objective to be the most sustainable manufacturer for individual premium mobility. A sustainable future is only possible when we are all pulling in the same direction. Franz Decker President and CEO BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. Catalysing Climate Change Actions Taking actions against climate change is one of our top business priorities, and we are change agents to drive green transformation across our entire value chain, from production to supply chain, logistics and dealer management. We successfully transitioned to 100 renewable electricity not only for our production base in Shenyang (since 2019), but also for all our non-production sites across China in 2021. Together with the state-of-the-art low-carbon technologies in our production, we were able to reduce CO2 emissions per vehicle produced year after year. To accel - erate sustainable transformation of our supply chain, we launched the Supply Chain Match Plan China, and one of the underlying ambitions are to enable our suppliers in Liaoning Province to transition to 100 renewable electricity by 2030. Likewise in our logistics operation, carbon reduction is a core mission under our new 2025 Aftersales Strategy, which has set ambitious targets to curb CO2 emissions from aftersales logistics. On the customer end, we are striving to create a low-carbon ecosystem along the customer journey. One landmark programme is the Network Transforma - tion Green Star Programme, which we are developing to enhance sustainable dealerships and services through four aspects green environment, green power, green operations, and green engagement. Over the course of this past year, we have continued to develop our charging infrastructure, making more re newable electricity available for our customers throughout the country. Biodiversity conservation is vital to building an ecological civili - sation, thus fulfilling the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in this area is more important than ever. In 2021, we launched our BMW Beautiful Homeland Initiative a new and long-term BMW CSR programme that focuses on biodi - versity conservation and public education with full engagement of stakehold - ers. We are proud to be the first premium OEM to embrace and contribute to biodiversity conservation in China. We are also ingraining this philosophy in our facilities by establishing ecological gardens, sponge city concepts and imple - menting nature-based solutions to foster a better environment for our people and our planet. Priorities in 2022 At BMW Brilliance, we believe the spirit of sustainability and cooperation is the only way forward to resolve the global challenges today. This year we are scaling up for our next phase of growth by expanding our production footprint, deepening our local supplier network, and launching the new future-orientated models. By manufacturing more of our products in China, our biggest single market, we are adding more constructive values for the local economy and for our Chinese customers. Furthermore, our new production plants adhere to the BMW iFACTORY principles of Lean, Green and Digital, reflecting our deter - mination to move forward together with China. While circular processes are not new for us, we have made great strides in recent years by increasing the volume of materials we recycle, in particular with our closed-loop system for steel and aluminium ingots. Another component in our push for sustainability is an expanded scope of parts-returns and reman - ufacturing, and further upgraded core tracing features for reverse logistics systems and improved overall parts-manufacturing capability. Our efforts have resulted in more efficient manufacturing, requiring fewer primary materials, and reducing our overall environmental impact. Today we must regard carbon as the new currency and remain industry leader in promoting a sustainable and green economy, by engaging and collaborating with our partners across value chain.

BEST ENTERPRISE PRACTICE AWARD 1st Rank BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE 11 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATIONPRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK THE CALL FOR CONCRETE ACTIONS In 2021, the world around us underwent drastic changes. BMW Brilliance is aware of the changes taking place in the environment and is reflecting upon the impact that our business has on it. We recognise the social responsibility that we take on as a leading player in China s automotive industry, and as such we are optimising our business to enhance sustainability, identifying potential opportunities, and exploring new ideas and directions for further growth with sustainability in mind. The objective is for us to not only achieve growth in this industry but also create a prosperous planet for the generations to come. Not only have these events caused adverse SUSTAINABILITY MEGATRENDS A company s success depends to a large extent on its ability to recognise changes in its business environment early on and make plans accordingly, so as to prevent damages from potential risks and seize opportunities. In 2021, we conducted various studies with qualitative and quantitative methodologies to analyse the sustainability megatrends around us, including the green power policy, biodiversity, climate risk and others. The purpose is to achieve not only growth in this industry, but also create a prosperous planet for the generations to come. effects on our business, it has also inflicted pain on many lives and further slowing down the economy. Concur - rently, COVID-19 continues to afflict populations around the world and is impacting economic recovery, creating uncertainty for the future. A progressive road map has been introduced in China as the country formal - ly commits to carbon neutrality by 2060, with a series of policies on energy transition, carbon market and circular economy coming up. As a leader in sustainability in the Chinese automotive industry, BMW Brilliance is in a constant endeavour to improve our operations and adapt to external chang - es while responding to national strategies. As part of our efforts to achieve sustainability, we are expanding our E-mobility initiative, revolutionising traditional travel with low-car - bon alternative methods. What is more, we are actively utilising new technology such as 5G, IoT, and AI in our push to fully digitalise our work and service. In do - ing so we are creating more possibilities to enhance our sustainability performance.

In 2021, with the launch of the new BMW iX3 and scaling up of charging facilities, we boosted new energy vehicle (NEV) sales and facilitated convenient long-distance low-carbon trav - el. Through our efforts, we have not only reached a milestone in using 100 renewable electricity in our production and non-production sites, but also paved the pathway for our dealers and business partners towards renewable electricity adoption through the BMW Green Power Alliance project. In utilising inno - vative methods to promote green logistics through the pilot use of E-Trucks, LNG Trucks and the wider adoption of railway transportation, we have further accelerated low-carbon transformation. CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIONS Every stakeholder is a valued partner in realising our goals. We joined hands with our suppliers to explore and innovate on the use of secondary materials. One of our key accomplishments was to push on a more sustain - able dealer network through the Network Trans - formation Green Star Programme. ACCOUNTABLE, CIRCULAR & RESILIENT VALUE CHAIN We are continuing to support our employees and aid their development, as well as care for the environ - ment in which we inhabit. Within our operations we are actively facilitating a more inclusive and diverse working environment that empowers employees of all genders. Apart from the competitive benefits programme and comprehensive training that we of - fer, we also have initiated education programmes to enhance the sustainability awareness and mindset across all our staff. In addition, we have launched a new CSR programme, the Beautiful Homeland Initiative, which focuses on protecting biodiversity and provides relevant education.

Under their guidance, we have integrated sustainability into key business decisions that direct our company forward. Sustainability is an in - tegral component in our annual target-setting process, which defines the targets each business function is required to meet. The Board of Management also oversees our compliance with all provisions of the law and internal regulations, as well as implementing risk management and conducting risk control measures. Since its establishment in 2020, the BMW Brilliance Corporate Sustainability Execution Committee has been fulfilling its responsibility of ensuring transparen - cy and facilitating common understanding on overall sustainability progress and target status across our value chain. Through monthly meetings and continuous engagement, the committee steered the cross-function communication and resource synergy, and promoted the sharing of insights, trends, and best practices to drive sustainability innovation and projects. Our aim is to minimise the adverse effects of climate change through risk management and become a more resilient mobility service provider. The first category is transition risks, which are related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy with extensive policy, legal, technology, reputation and market changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements re - lated to climate change. The second category is phys - ical risks, which are related to the physical impacts of climate change and can be event-driven (acute, like hurricanes and floods) or longer-term shifts (chronic, the rise of sea levels) in climate patterns. By conducting megatrend analysis, literature review and peer benchmarking, we have identified 3 tiers of key transition and physical climate change risks, including the increased severity of extreme weather events, shifts in consumer preferences and increased costs of GHG emissions. As a result, all risks were listed on the heatmap and integrated into the corpo - rate risk report for further evaluation. Our next step is to conduct a quantitative analysis of climate-related risks to provide a more concrete financial reference for the strategy design and decision making. Jun Wang Senior Vice President Finance By assessing various emerging risks, including climate change s impact on our business, we are better prepared for the future by enhancing our resilience to potential extreme events.

Despite the negative impact of the pandemic, we have continued our inclusive stakeholder engagement efforts with a view to gather all stakeholders feedback. Our ultimate aim is to establish an ongoing, transparent dialogue that serves to bolster mutual trust to help guide BMW Brilliance s decision-making processes in the best possible way. BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE 17 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATIONPRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND COLLABORATION Our communications with stakeholders provide us with a host of viewpoints concerning sustainability, which, in turn, inspires us to optimise our management approach and methods. In February 2021, the previ - ous incumbent mayor of Shenyang Municipal People s Government, Mr. Wang Xinwei visited Plant Tiexi, and widely acknowledged BMW Brilliance s contributions to the local economy. In December 2021, at the Sustainabil - ity BMW Shenyang Plants event, our up-to-date sus - tainability achievements and management approaches were presented to Shan Yi, Vice Mayor of Shenyang, Li Gang, Secretary of Dadong District CPC Committee, participating journalists and suppliers. We have long treated our suppliers as indispensable partners who enable us to realise a sustainable and cir - cular value chain. In June 2021, our key suppliers were invited to the German Association of the Automotive In - dustry Quality Management Centre (VDA QMC) Regional Conference, where we shared insights on achieving sus - tainable and high-quality development in today s digital age. In addition, green transformation and sustainability were also highlighted during the BMW Brilliance Supplier Media Visit, where we presented the best sustainable practices to realise a sustainable supply chain. In June 2021, the BMW Brilliance BASF Tech Day was successfully held, with more than 1, 000 senior managers and industrial experts taking part. As a result, a further consensus on the continuing cooperation has been established in order to ensure long-term sustainable development for both sides. In the same month, the first Open World Event ended successfully with the guests attendances from Alibaba Group. This event allowed us to expand our hori - zons with the latest technological developments to better promote our digital transformation.

In this way, we are better able to leverage strengths from both sides to enhance overall sustainable development and ultimately create shared value. BMW Brilliance maintains a close relationship with the China Automotive Technology and Research Centre (CATARC), one of the Chinese automotive industry s leading associations. In 2021, our excellent performance earned us CATARC recognition. BMW Brilliance was awarded the China-New Car Assess - ment Programme (C-NCAP) Safety Contribution Award by CATARC, and we have been continually ranked No. 1 on the Automotive Industry Green Development Index. In terms of our collaboration with civil society, based on our strong partnership with the China Education Devel - opment Foundation and China Green Foundation, we are exploring new areas while also addressing other emerging issues. We also upgraded the BMW JOY Home programme via a new Self-Strength - ening Movement which focuses on the revitalisation of rural education. In March 2021, we held a series of events in support of the Earth Hour 2021 initiated by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Our employees got a better un - derstanding of how to put the concept of sustainability into actual practice by turning off the electric devices, saving toiletries and driving in BMW models ECO PRO mode. Furthermore, multiple workshops were held to help motivate and empower our business partners to transition to renewable electricity. In the fall of 2021, the workshop for dealer partners attracted over 150 participants from 104 dealer groups; whereas the workshop for non-production sites drew over 50 participants from real estate landlords, relevant business departments and facility operators. In the future, we will develop practice manuals to provide professional guidance and technical support to our dealers and real estate partners on renewable electricity adoption. Our commitment to integrity and corporate responsibility guides everything we do at BMW Brilliance.

The 2021 Compliance Risk As - sessment heat map shows increasing risk levels for the most compliance subjects, which is in line with today s stricter external regulatory environment. In response to this, a variety of mitigation measures were developed and implemented. As an integral part of an effective compliance man - agement system, the robust organisational frame - work of BMW Brilliance has ensured that a proper compliance accountability structure is put in place. A ROBUST GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE BMW Brilliance has established a robust organisational framework to ensure a proper compliance accounta - bility structure. The Board of Directors (BoD) of BMW Brilliance assumes the ultimate responsibility for ad - ministering a compliance management system at the shareholder level. The Audit and Compliance Commit - tee (AC) under the BoD sets compliance objectives, allocates resources and monitors practices to ensure complete compliance with all regulatory and ethical requirements. Authorised by the BoD, BMW Bril - liance s Board of Management (BoM) and Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee, serving as its sub-committee, takes the primary over-sight role. And a dedicated department of Corporate Governance and Compliance was established to manage overall com - pliance programmes. COMPLIANCE GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT Given the uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and ever stricter regulatory requirements around the globe, placing integrity at the heart of our business strategy is not only a best practice, but also vital for our company s long-term survival. Since 2020, several compliance topics such as antitrust, cybersecurity and data security have been put at centre stage. The topic list may continue to grow and remain highly active in the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, a series of law enforcement moves in China has sent a powerful signal from top regulators about their determination to see tightened regulations are closely adhered to. At BMW Brilliance, a well-functioning and dynamic compliance management system has become increasingly important for the company s sustainable future success.

In terms of antitrust, we will continue to review and rein - force our antitrust management system as well as all per - tinent penalty mechanisms. The specific antitrust targets will be included as part of the overall 2022 compliance targets for all managers and antitrust compliance require - ments will be included in the job descriptions for relevant staff members. GENERAL MEASURES - PREVENTION, DETECTION AND REMEDIATION BMW Brilliance regularly implements a wide range of prevention, detection, and remediation measures to manage its com - pliance risks. To this end, nine compliance speeches were delivered by BoM members during a variety of activities in 2021. A culture of compliance was also nurtured through compliance target, legal monitoring, policies, training, communication, and pre-approval processes via the E-compliance systems. BMW Brilliance uncovers potential compliance issues in several ways, including case investigations, special reviews, routine audits, and other methods. When problems are identified, we initiate disciplinary measures in a strict and consistent manner against those employees or business partners who have violated external regulations or internal policies. One of the key components of compliance is to ensure the process of reporting compliance concerns is as easy as possible. In 2021, the company further officially promoted the BMW Group SpeakUP line to business partners. BMW Brilliance is fully committed to lawful and respon - sible business conduct, and we also demand high ethical standards from our business partners. By creating a culture of compliance across our entire supply chain, we will reinforce trust between BMW Brilliance and our business partners and maintain business rela - tionships in a stronger and more sustainable manner. At the same time, we will initiate prudent measures to enhance the overall capacity and capabilities of forensic technology in investigation. For this reason, the fight against non-compliance will remain a focal point for us in the foreseeable future. That is why we must practise constant vigilance and redouble our efforts to ensure thorough, effective and timely implementation of all compliance programmes and processes. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 202122 DATA PRIVACY AND INFORMATION SECURITY1. 4 At BMW Brilliance, we recognise the importance of data privacy and information security, and we have expended determined effort in building a strong infrastructure to safeguard us from threats. Thanks to our robust compliance culture, we are able to rapidly respond to regulation changes to ensure that we are fully complied with cybersecurity and data-protection regulations and standards in China and beyond.

In the long term, we will set up a PIPL Programme to focus on the PIPL and important vehicle data cross border. The programme will bring changes to our governance structure, where we have introduced 4 dedicated roles Cybersecurity Officer (CSO), Data Security Officer (DSO), Data Priva - cy Officer (DPO), and Automotive Data Security Officer (ADSO). Their responsibility is to manage personnel, processes, and automotive data by utilising a series of features that we have developed. At all corporate-level digitisation programmes, such as cloud transformation, 5G IoT as well as digital plant, our core focus is to ensure cybersecurity. Among all the digitalisation programmes initiated by different business units, we have designated a dedicated posi - tion, the Security Matter Expert, with a set of standard instructions to ensure information security across the entire digitisation process. INFORMATION SECURITY As information security is of the utmost importance to BMW Brilliance, we have ceaselessly strived to improve the security measures. This year we have been able to expand the scope of information security governance framework by incorporating individual applications from our business into our own governance framework.

We have fully complied with all regulatory requirements related to HVB lifecycle management. All batteries are 100 traceable, collected and recycled by BMW. In 2021, we recy - cled 6, 173 pieces of HVBs, a 42 increase from 2020. This was achieved through optimising our collection and recycling processes. To this end, we conducted training exercises with dealers to ensure that they maintain our standards when handling HVBs. BMW Brilliance s professional HVB Recycling Service outlet in Shanghai is currently en - joying successful operations, earning widespread praise and recognition from the local government. PIONEERING SECONDARY USE OF HVBS We have been focusing our efforts on pioneering R&D on secondary use scenarios for HVBs. After six months into the pilot scheme, these HVBs demonstrated out - standing power resilience and safety performance. The goal is to effectively extract and put them into new battery pro - duction from 2022 onward. Key materials in HVBs nickel, cobalt, and lithium are then recycled into manufacturing new batteries. This process will ultimately help replace mined resources. By the end of 2021, 554 BMW dealers have established the recycling procedure for HVBs across China. Furthering HVB Research Through Cooperation with Tsinghua University Collaboration Over a two-year period, we have partnered with Tsing - hua University on HVB market research, battery lifecy - cle carbon emission calculations, and reusable battery development. The success of these pilot schemes was supported by adhering to a strict oper - ational process that ensured the safety and optimal performance of the HVBs.

We have been initiating different programmes to enhance the efficiency and usability of our current bins while also exploring the possibility of recycling and remanufacturing bins to achieve material circularity in our supply chain. Our programme was initiated in March 2021 and completed by the end of 2021. A total of 1, 350 piec - es of steel bin can be reused in the next project. We also conducted a feasibility study on the use of non- steel bins to evaluate the use of expanded polypropyl - ene (EPP) renewable material (from EOP bins and daily scrap material). This study led us to a conclusion that a ratio of 75 new material to 25 recycled material used in producing new bins will meet our required EPP bin functions. As a result, we are now in negotiations with our EPP supplier to conclude a recycling and trans - portation contract. MAXIMISING BIN USABILITY In addition to recycling and reuse of packaging ma - terials, we have improved upon BMW Brilliance s bin concept construction guidelines by incorporating a light bin design standard, which has greatly increased efficiency. Our bin-sharing and rental programme has achieved excellent results, with our top five parts suppliers making use of rental bins 35, 545 times in 2021. The current scope of applica - tions covers existing projects and will eventually be extended to new vehicle projects. In June 2021, we started a project to optimise pack - aging density that was completed at the end of 2021. The result is that Plant Tiexi has already achieved nearly 0. 101 m per car saving in packaging while Plant Dadong has saved approximately 0. 166 m per car. We have also published a CO emissions matrix on different package materials and provided guidance on the best material choices for the bin design. This plan includes fulfilling a remanufactured product line of electronic steering gear while achiev - ing SOP for the remanufacturing extension of AC compressors. The plan also covers releasing remanufactured me - chatronics to fit on hybrid cars, and the beginning of using remanufactured engine components, alterna - tors, and head unit extensions. This plan will also im - prove the systematic solutions of core classifications and sorting standards. The results of the secondary utilisation pilot pro - grammes will be evaluated for a possible mass rollout. In 2022, with new requirements in place for recycling suppliers, we will form a closed-loop of HVB recycling, which involves all recycled raw mate - rials being reused by our own suppliers.

As a result, our energy consumption per vehicle produced has decreased for four consecutive years since 2016. In 2021, we investigated the viability of hydrogen and biogas to replace fossil energy. After close examination and tech - nical feasibility study of several solutions, we will further evaluate the performance and efficacy of each solution in more comprehensive terms. STEAM PLATFORM Inspiring energy management innovationJoint collaboration to boost carbon emissions research Green measures Collaboration In 2021, the Standard Tool for Efficiency Applications and Measures (STEAM) platform, a key energy-saving initia - tive, played an important role in facilitating energy man - agement innovation. We introduced this platform to provide employees with a way to submit their innovative ideas for energy efficiency improvements during production pro - cesses. In 2021, our staff members submitted 42 measures to the platform, which will ultimately result in a combined savings of over 5, 000 MWh of energy use per year. In 2021, BMW Brilliance initiated a cooperative intention with State Grid and Northeastern Uni - versity on the development of a Carbon Footprint Management Platform. In the near future, with this platform in place, we will be able to achieve more precise carbon footprint management.

In this regard, we have repurposed end- of-life materials in new ways by developing innovative approaches. About 170 t of iron sludge waste from Plant Powertrain is no longer landfilled, 99. 5 of which was recycled. Thanks to the optimised sludge treatment facilities and processes at Shenyang Plants, the waste per vehicle produced we sent off for disposal in 2021 decreased from 2. 99 to 2. 50 kg. VOC EMISSIONS REDUCTION Since 2021, Plant Tiexi and Plant Dadong Extension Projects have completed the installation of state-of- the-art volatile organic compounds (VOC) treatment facilities, which have made significant contributions towards VOC reduction. By the end of 2021, we have cut VOC emissions per vehicle produced by 76. LAND USE AND BIODIVERSITY Sustainability is closely intertwined with ecology and environmental protection. As a front runner in BMW s global production network, the BMW Brilliance Shen - yang plant has pioneered the concept of sponge plant and nature-based solutions during the planning and implementation of the new project, actively adopted soil and water conservation measures, and selected a landscape design with more functions to protect the biodiversity of the plant. In 2021, we achieved 1. 82 m3 of water consumption per vehicle produced, an improve - ment of 1. 97 m3 from 2020 level. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE INTRODUCTION PRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION GREEN PRACTICES AT PLANT LYDIA BMW Brilliance is ceaselessly pursuing a more sustainable production process. The new Plant Lydia, which commenced production officially in May 2022, reflects our green ambitions in this first-of-its-kind, state-of-the- art auto manufacturing facility. In 2021, our first Combined Heating and Power (CHP) in Liaoning has already began operation at Plant Lydia. This system enables energy transformation from coal to natural gas, which is expected to reduce CO emissions by 50 through energy replacement. The CHP will pro - vide supplies of electricity, heating and serve as a con - venient transfer method from natural gas to biogas. In the future, the CHP could provide electricity and heating via a dedicated pipeline. Other measures include opti - mising the use of solar energy through solar photovoltaic RESOURCE UTILISATION IMPROVEMENT Comprehensive water efficiency measurements were taken at Plant Lydia. Consequently, a total water con - sumption target has been set to measure the progress and outcome of our resource-saving actions. More panel installations are planned in both the produc - tion facilities and reserve area as well. The estimated capacity of solar photovoltaics is currently 23 MW, and we are actively exploring the potential to expand this share of on-site renewable electricity generation. An electricity consumption target has already been set for Plant Lydia, which has also become a requirement for our equipment suppliers. In addition, we have adopted the pilot use of an E-oven, which is powered by renewable electricity to reduce CO2 emissions by replacing natural gas usage. Jochen Esmann Head of Tiexi New Plant (Lydia) Project We believe green production is the key to solving the sustainability puzzle. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE INTRODUCTION PRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION 2022 FORECAST In 2022, a series of steps to enhance green production are under planning. In terms of carbon footprint and re - newable energy, the standards of National Green Plant and ISO 50001 will be extended to cover Plant Lydia. In addition, we will continue to explore the possibility of energy replacement, with heat pumps and biogas, for instance. In the future, cooper - ation with research institutions will be strengthened to better leverage digital technologies for CO reduction. Especially at our new plants, more definitive sustaina - bility actions will be taken. To this end, the Plant Da - dong Extension Projects will carry out phase III water reclamation capacity expansion, which will save nearly 130, 000 m of water per year upon commencement. And at both Plant Lydia and Plant Dadong, a new paint material with lower VOCs and higher solid content will be applied. PROMOTING CIRCULARITY In terms of our furniture selection, our principle for Plant Lydia is to reuse secondary office furniture from other plants as much as possible. As for the produc - tion process, we have built the capacity to separate iron and aluminium from mixed metal waste to provide better circulation. ECOLOGICAL CONSERVATION An ecological conservation garden will be built at Plant Lydia near the southwest assembly area for employ - ees to visit during lunch breaks and leisure time. Native species will be cultivated to preserve local biodiversity, and a small artificial lake will be included, supplied by rainwater or grey water. Water conservation measures will also be taken, including putting a clay layer in the soil to better hold water for healthy tree growth. tem for irrigation, collecting used water from production for secondary use such as car washing, and installing wastewater treatment facilities, all of which can save 40, 000 m3 of water per year. In our Press Shop, we developed a main drive control cabinet on the second floor, which can reduce approximately 5 of power through improved energy efficiency and being totally free from the chiller water. In addition, the e-coating reverse osmosis filtration system also allows for reduced fresh water consumption while lowering hazardous waste. INBOUND LOGISTICS FINISHED VEHICLE LOGISTICS AFTERSALES LOGISTICS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 49 BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK PRODUCTS AND SERVICES EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETY OTHER INFORMATION INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS GREEN LOGISTICSBMW Brilliance strives to create the greenest and most innovative products in the in - dustry and bring them to our customers with the utmost speed and efficiency. We are fully committed to achieving the clear sus - tainability goals that the BMW Group has set for 2030. We scrutinised every link in our logistics chain and have devised tailored optimisations for each step in the process. Our goal is to improve resiliency while simultaneously providing steady supplies to our plants, dealers, and customers. We have piloted the use of the first E-Trucks for our inbound logistics, implemented railway-to-railway transportation as well as upgraded our resilient logistics management for finished ve - hicles. Above all, we developed a new aftersales strategy along with improved green warehouse management for aftersales logistics. st 50 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE INTRODUCTION PRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION EXPLORING ALTERNATIVE FUEL ADOPTION FOR HEAVY VEHICLE TRANSPORTATION We are ceaselessly searching for cleaner and more efficient fuel in our logistics operations, as it is a vital factor in the future of sustainable transportation. In 2021, we initiated a pilot of an E-Truck, which was the first heavy E-Truck (20 t) used in Shenyang. The battery of the E-Truck is powered by 100 renewable electricity, which could transport 56 White Car Bodies of the BMW iX3 per day, and is estimated to reduce 2. 2 t of CO per year and produce zero hazardous pollutants as compared to traditional fossil fuel. This programme is under evaluation and is set to be rolled out for use in inner-plant and inter-plant logistics in 2022. Shipments of cargo from Dali - an Port to our Shenyang plant are currently conducted through railway, with Plant Tiexi receiving 50 of their shipments and Plant Dadong receiving 90 of their shipments by train. Alongside our efforts to increase the share of rail and sea transportation that we utilise, we are also optimising our road transportation by maximising the payload mass to reduce transport frequency and integrating low-car - bon criteria into our supplier selection process. Potential suppliers are encouraged to adopt low-carbon transpor - tation modes and utilise the full-truckload method. BUILDING RESILIENT LOGISTICS THROUGH RISK MANAGEMENT BMW Brilliance highly values stability in our inbound logistics, and as such we are pro-actively monitoring potential risks, including climate-related risks, and providing preventive solutions to build resilient logistics. Front-desk meetings are conducted to identify poten - tial risks and cross-functional meetings are held every week to assess potential risks across the entire logistics IMPROVING LOGISTICS EFFICIENCY THROUGH DIGITAL PLANNING We are utilising digital planning to enhance the efficiency of shipment loading, which has resulted in a reduction of carbon emissions from our vehicles. The Plant Traffic Steering System (PTSS) has been utilised to moni - tor real-time intersection traffic. Our planning system actively analyses traffic conditions and optimises truck dispatches to avoid congestions to enhance efficiency. Sustainability has long been one of the basic tenets of BMW Brilliance s in - bound logistics planning and operations. Through promoting low-carbon modes of transportation, deploying new trans - portation vehicles and making progress in digitalisation, we have established a more low-carbon, resilient, and efficient inbound logistics system. In the event of a potential risk being discovered, preventive measures will be taken to mitigate possible negative impacts, such as increasing the capacity of storage based on traffic condition forecasts. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE INTRODUCTION PRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION With the goal of maximising efficiency and minimising carbon emissions in our mind, we have merged the logistics segments for local produced finished vehicle and imported finished vehicle. As a streamlined organisation, the new team is striving to hasten synergies and efficiency, speed up innovation and dig - italisation to realise future sustainable business models. FINISHED VEHICLE LOGISTICS PURSUING A LOW-CARBON TRANSPORTATION MODE In our transportation of finished vehicles, we continue to practise railway-to-railway transportation to improve efficiency while reducing CO emissions. Having main - tained a robust railway transportation network, we are transporting 78 of locally produced finished vehicles wholly or partially by rail, a shift from the traditional road to rail mode. The incident in 2021 which obstructed the Suez Canal effectively handicapped global sea transportation. Dur - ing that period, railway proved to be a reliable and stable mode of transportation. In 2021, BMW became the first premium OEM to utilise the Sino-European railway and the Chengdu compre - hensive bonded zone for vehicle imports. Chengdu became the first railway import port for finished vehicles within the logistics network in China, which is an effec - tive complement when the sea freight capacity is insuf - ficient. E-Trucks have emerged as a strong candidate. Upon evaluation of the truck s battery efficiency, charging sta - tion availability, and speed and route, we have identified 2 technical challenges. One is the instability of the battery s life utilised, and another is the lack of perfect hydrau - lic functions. Our solution is to cooperate with E-Truck suppliers to develop new products that meet our require - ments and optimise charging facilities along the routes. OUR APPROACH TO USING ALTERNATIVE FUEL IN FINISHED VEHICLE LOGISTICS Action Challenge Solution E-Truck Battery instability Collaboration with E-Truck suppliers to develop new products Optimise charging and supporting facilities along logistic routes LNG-Truck High maintenance cost Limited LNG support facilitites Lower payload capacity Establish strategic cooperation between logistics suppliers and LNG Truck OEMs Further construction of LNG supporting facilities along logistics routes Expand LNG pilot programme to Shenyang-Beijing Hydrogen Fuel Technological barrier Continue exploration of hydrogen application opportunitiy in transportation vehiclesIn addition to E-Trucks, we have been exploring the use of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) Trucks in Decentralised Dispatch Area (DDA) cities. While LNG fuel has poten - tial to lower our carbon footprint, we have identified a number of challenges, including high maintenance costs, limited LNG support facilities along routes, and a de - crease in payload capacity. BMW Brilliance has facilitated a strategic cooperation between our logistics suppliers and LNG Truck OEMs to develop new trucks that can load eight units of finished vehicles. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE INTRODUCTION PRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION MORE RESILIENT LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT In 2021, faced with unprecedented effects of extreme weather, the ongoing pandemic, as well as other emer - gencies, BMW Brilliance has optimised its logistics management to remain resilient against such challeng - es. During site selection processes we have considered evaluations for the risk of natural disasters. We have also implemented preventive measures into our operations, such as daily monitoring of weather conditions, installing solar panels at the outdoor parking of Plant Lydia and Plant Dadong Extension Projects, and building sheds to prevent hail in the Chengdu DDA. Alongside our preven - tive measures, we are preparing a contingency plan by developing alternative routes and readying secondary modes of transportation to ensure stable logistics during emergencies such as pandemics, typhoons, or floods. INNOVATING THROUGH DIGITAL MANAGEMENT OF LOGISTICS In 2021, our Vehicle distribution Management (VDM) sys - tem went live, empowering the digital and smart man - agement of finished vehicle logistics. The VDM system is a comprehensive platform that allows for real-time vehicle location tracking, paperless operation, and man - agement dashboard to create the overall transparency of the business status. This system is also a vital step to contribute to the digitalisation and innovation. The data which is collected via every single handling step in the logistics chain from VDM will be saved in Cloud Data Hub (CDH) for the analysis to generate the direction for our further carbon reductions. Data-driven logistics is the base of never-ending sustainable improvements.

Natural rainwater is collected through this system and is later utilised for car washing which not only conserves water expenditure but also independent utilities network and is thus more resilient against extreme weather conditions. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE INTRODUCTION PRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION AFTERSALES LOGISTICS Aftersales service is a vital component for BMW Brilliance s sustainable value chain. For which we have developed the 2025 Aftersales Strategy, that sets sustainability as one of our cor - nerstones. As part of our new strat - egy, we have set an ambitious carbon reduction target in 2026 to further reduce our carbon emissions by 1 3. For international spare parts, we are work - ing to minimise airfreight replenishment as it generates a substantial amount of CO and gradually substitute it with railway transportation, the greener option. In 2021, 20 of our urgent airfreight replenishments were replaced by rail, thus reducing CO emissions by 10, 000 t. Our target is to replace 50 of urgent airfreight replenishments with greener transportation modes by 2026. Apart from more efficient and greener modes of trans - portation, we have optimised our inventory management system to adjust the usage of railway transportation based on market predictions, and we are seeking out local sourcing solutions for spare parts to avoid unnecessary international transportation. For domestic logistics, our aim is to lower our impact on the environment by increasing share of electric vehi - cles used. We have steadily deployed battery-powered E-Trucks to deliver parts from Spare Parts Distribution Centre to our dealers. In 2021, two E-Trucks were de - ployed in the Spare Parts Distribution Centre in Foshan, and one E-Truck was deployed in the Spare Parts Distri - bution Centre in Hefei, both showing positive results. Our target is to reach 50 utilisation of E-Trucks in Dealer Metro Distribution Centre (DMDC) delivery routes in 2026. Our interim target is to establish a CO2 baseline condition and identify prelimi - nary decarbonisation approaches for aftersales logistics. And our aftersales service is a critical component of achieving a sustainable value chain. AFTERSALES LOGISTICS 2026 CARBON REDUCTION TARGETS 54 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE INTRODUCTION PRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION GREEN WAREHOUSE MANAGEMENT At BMW Brilliance, logistics performance is measured with sustainability factors, and in terms of warehouse management, the green warehouse is now our opera - tional standard. On the forefront of renewable electric - ity adoption, we were able to realise 100 renewable electricity for our six Spare Parts Distribution Centres across China in 2021 through I-RECs. Through maintaining a certain stock of new or slow-moving parts at the Spare Parts Distribution Centre in Shanghai, we could avoid urgent internation - al airfreight and thus contribute to carbon reduction. In addition, all the new Spare Parts Distribution Centres will take part in the BMW Green Power Alliance project to adopt 100 renewable electricity with priority on power. Sustaina - bility is now a KPI that we take into consideration during our warehouse supplier selection process. One detail we would like to see from our suppliers is for at least 50 of the packaging used to be returnable. As part of our push to make our warehouses greener, BMW Brilliance is planning to limit and reduce paper consumption. One example is to employ returnable packaging for Spare Parts Distribution Centre to dealer deliveries. We will also utilise electronic devices for business operations, such as using scanners during stocktakes to completely replace paper records. At the dealership level, we have implemented e-recep - tion, e-workshops, and e-payments to minimise paper use in our service process. For inbound logistics, we are conducting further LNG Truck pilots to resolve its challenges and optimise its functions. As LNG is more carbon-efficient, we hope to increase its scope in the future. E-Trucks will be rolled out for inner-plant and inter-plant transportations. Our finished vehicle logistics work will focus on explor - ing the possibility of using the Sino-Europe railway to export products such as the BMW iX3. Finally, in terms of aftersales logistics, we will continu - ously promote our green logistic initiatives while explor - ing new possibilities of other clean energy solutions for transportation, including LNG and hydrogen.

By means of the Supply Chain Match Plan China, we can leverage different ways to reduce carbon emissions throughout the entire supply chain. We are also focusing our attention on adopting renewable electricity sources for ourselves and our suppliers. BMW Brilliance also has in place an effective EHS management methodology that helps identify a wide range of risks that threaten sustainable operations. These measures, along with serious concerns about ethical sourcing of materials, reflect our sincere dedication to ensuring that all of our busi - ness practices are sustainable and contribute to a healthy global environment. billion RMB 30. 1 vs 2020 56 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE INTRODUCTION PRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION ADOPTING RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN Renewable electricity is a crucial point of focus for BMW Brilliance to mobilise and encourage suppliers to make use of carbon-free power sources. To this end, we have conducted electricity mapping at our suppliers together with training to help them with renewable electricity pur - chases, and share our know-how and lessons learned from our journey of transitioning to 100 renewable electricity in production. Our HVB Tier 1 supplier, CATL, from whom we purchased HVBs of 4. 14 GWh in 2021, achieved 100 renewable electricity in 2021. Our SUPPLY CHAIN CARBON REDUCTION In order to meet the BMW Group s ambitious 2030 goal of cutting supply chain CO emis - sions per vehicle produced by more than 20, as compared to 2019 level, while also meeting the Chinese government s dual carbon goals, BMW Brilliance has implemented a determined approach comprising a series of concrete ac - tions in the Supply Chain Match Plan China. MANAGEMENT APPROACH Sustainability has been comprehensively integrated into BMW Brilliance s supply chain management strat - egy. Through the use of role-modelling and enabling, we are helping to drive a low-carbon transition along the entire supply chain to achieve our ambitious com - mitments for carbon reduction. To this end, low carbon output has become a key criterion in our purchasing strategy, and we give priority to those suppliers who achieve lower carbon footprints. SUPPLY CHAIN MATCH PLAN CHINA In 2021, the Supply Chain Match Plan China programme was a major milestone for BMW Brilliance to develop an integrated and customised plan for sustainable supply chain management across China. A dedicated team was also established for the Match Plan to develop a comprehensive management system in order to better coordinate a working synergy and cooperative mindset among different departments. aluminium ingot suppliers, from whom we purchased a total of 20, 000 t aluminium ingot, also achieved 100 renewable electricity in 2021. Our carbon reduction philosophy also influences suppli - ers to actively consider sustainability issues during the construction and operation of their facilities. For exam - ple, greater numbers of suppliers are now considering the installation of solar photovoltaic panels during the site selection stage of their construction planning.

It also covers 10 processes, including risk identification, policy trends, process optimisation, database informa - tion management, training, auditing, early warning, and fast response. Our approach provides all suppliers with corrective actions and continuous capacity-building activities. For high-risk suppliers, on-site assessments are conducted via an independent third party. For low-risk suppliers, we have a self-assessment checklist and a special Challenge Round. OPTIMISATION OF EHS MANAGEMENT We have optimised our EPA programme by getting more suppliers involved while also enriching the contents of the digital management system. In 2021, the scope of the Challenge Round was expanded. Previously, it was for internal staff members, but this year we have includ - ed Tier-1 suppliers who are responsible for N-Tiers. BMW Brilliance guided the process to help Tier-1 suppli - ers become responsible for their own supply chain per - formance results. It is also equipped with an external risk event-track - ing module to provide suppliers with a rapid feedback function for external events, placing greater focus on suppliers EHS risks within the manufacturing sector. SUPPLIER EHS MANAGEMENT ACHIEVEMENTS In 2021, we audited 51 companies from our supply chain, comprising 20 nominated suppliers and 31 N-Tier suppli - ers. The initial audit result for 2021 was 14 red 8 yellow 29 green. By the end of 2021, we successfully improved the average audit score from an initial 88 to 95. In addition, several risk management activities were carried out on environmental and social matters, including risk management for heavy pollution output during winter weather. We have pioneered a concrete and holistic supplier EHS risk management system through our Environment, Health and Safety Protection Activity (EPA) programme that has set a bench - mark for EHS within our industry. Moreover, we completed four internal training sessions and designed a video training course for suppliers, which went live with training sessions in December 2021. ETHICAL AND TRANSPARENT SOURCING OF HVB RAW MATERIALS Material-specific sourcing strategies were initiated by BMW Brilliance to guarantee maximum transparency while fostering responsible business practices across our entire supply chain. We recognised the importance of responsi - ble procurement of raw materials when sourcing from regions experiencing political and social conflicts, which 2022 FORECAST Looking ahead in 2022, as the development of our Supply Chain Match Plan China progresses, addi - tional specific indicators and targets will be set to better measure and manage our performance. In addition, we are exploring the application of other renewable electricity solutions. In terms of supplier EHS management, we have combined the EHS scheme and social responsibility programme, allowing us to integrate internal stand - ards into the entire supply chain. As a result, we will provide social responsibility training to suppliers while conducting ongoing EPA audits. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 202159 BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK PRODUCTS AND SERVICES EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETY OTHER INFORMATION INTRODUCTION FUNDAMENTALS REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENTBMW Brilliance is taking firm actions to transform our non-produc - tion sites into low-carbon, green and healthy working environments. We are rethinking our approach to the entire lifecycle of our various non-production sites with enhanced sustainability in mind. This encompasses everything from site selection and building design, to construction and facility management. Our aim is to minimise the overall environmental impact in terms of carbon footprint, waste and consumption of natural resources at our facilities. At the same time, we are striving to foster a thriving, sup - portive, and healthy working environment for our employees. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE INTRODUCTION PRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORK FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESEMPLOYEE AND SOCIETYOTHER INFORMATION PROMOTING PRUDENT ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT BMW Brilliance stays in regular communication with employees concerning green operations and promptly responds to sustainability issues. To this end, we publish Partner Satisfaction Index on regular basis to various internal customers and shareholders on selected real estate management topics of major importance. Moreover, an employee survey was also conducted on the office waste management topic to gain a better un - derstanding of employees overall awareness, as well as to consider the optimal way to implement their sugges - tions on a scheme for waste classification at the office. As a result, based on the analysis of our current perfor - mance, we collectively came up with several creative proposals on how to improve office waste management. The next step will involve taking further action to facili - tate better office waste management through enhancing our waste classification system and increasing employee awareness on this matter. INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY INTO REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION PROCESS BMW Brilliance ceaselessly works to integrate more sus - tainable factors into its selection criteria for non-produc - tion sites, which forges solid, sustainable foundations for greener operations. To this end, we will give a stronger focus on sustainability when choos - ing proprietors, especially those holding sustainable building certifications or being equipped with renewable electricity supply. In addition, environmental impact as - sessments will be carried out to improve each building s overall sustainability performance. Sustainability will also be an essential factor for new facilities when we are evaluating partnerships with potential qualified suppliers and contractors. In 2021, we benchmarked with the world s lead - ing green building standards LEED and WELL. Furthermore, we have also leveraged digital solutions to strengthen our environmental management. In our future efforts to optimise the management of the 25 non-produc - tion sites across China, including the new ones under con - sutruction, we will actively seek to digitalise our work-re - lated tasks to become greener and more sustainable. This platform can effectively integrate a variety of functions, including data maintenance, performance reporting, regulation tracking, training, as well as audit support, to help improve overall facility management.

The Board of Directors (BoD) of BMW Brilliance assumes the ultimate respon - sibility for administering the compliance management system at the shareholder level. The Audit and Compliance Committee (AC) under the BoD sets compliance objectives, allocates resources and monitors practices to ensure complete compliance with all regulatory and ethical requirements. A dedicated department of Corporate Governance and Compliance was established to manage overall compliance programmes. Its department head then reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer of the company. Moreover, the broader compliance steering depart - ments also collaborate to enable business departments to implement compliance pro - grammes in their daily operations, and to help mitigate compliance risks more effectively. As the Compliance Responsible of each department, the department heads have the duty to make sure they and their teams act in full compliance. Moreover, the role of Compliance Interface, which serves as a bridge between business operations and the central compliance function, was created and nominated by all departments. Customised education and com - munication channels are provided across the broader compliance network, and consultant services are always available to support their daily operations. COMPLIANCE TRAINING In 2021, 22 one-on-one sessions were arranged with the newly onboard Compliance Re - sponsible and Compliance Interface. Two workshops were held to reinforce compliance requirements while facilitating the discussion over a host of challenges and hot topics, and the best practices were shared among the participants. Around 120 Compliance Interface managers attended various events.

In 2021, all our production plants successfully passed the ISO 14001 2015 Environmental Management System certificate renewal audit. In order to better meet the stringent environmental protection requirements that our diverse stakeholders established, we have proactively updated and optimised many environmental procedures that are now already in effect. RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT To avoid foreseeable risks and integrate eco-friendly concepts as early as possible, we have an environmental management department that goes into action during the project design phase to analyse and assess all possible environmental impacts. During the construction phase, we monitor environmental risks and ensure compliance with the project team. For small-scale project modifications, the project team consults with the environmental manage - ment team to evaluate any possible environmental impacts and recommends eco-friendly thinking in the early production stages by completing a change management checklist. The environmental management team also works in tandem with the compliance team to stay up to date on all regulatory changes. A total of 46 items were identified as a result of en - vironmental laws and regulations updates, and the evaluation results were published on the company s Legislation Express. We are confident in mapping out strategies to fulfil the latest stakeholder requirements and expectations. BMW Brilliance takes great pride in placing environmental concerns at the core of its en - tire operations. VOC EMISSIONS REDUCTION In 2021, our Plant Tiexi and Plant Dadong Extension Projects completed the installation of state-of-the-art volatile organic compounds (VOC) treatment facilities, which will make a significant contribution towards VOC emissions reduction. By the end of 2021, we cut per-ve - hicle VOC emissions by 76 from 0. 50 to 0. 12 kg per vehicle. COMPREHENSIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT Today we have greater capabilities than ever before to reduce and sustainably manage the waste generated by our operations. This new system is much more reliable and will help significantly improve our on-site waste management efforts by enhancing the traceability requirement process. We have also optimised waste recycling methods at our production plants. For example, since January 2021, nearly 150 t year of wet iron sludge waste was sent for incineration, gen - erating 375, 000 kWh. Furthermore, around 20 t year of dry iron sludge waste was diverted from landfill and recycled to produce 20 t year of auxiliary raw materials. At Plant Dadong, our sludge dehydration programme was initiated in 2021, which significantly decreased the water content of sludge by 40, eventually lowering overall sludge generation by nearly one kg per vehicle produced. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT RESOURCE CONSUMPTION AND EFFICIENCY MEASURES FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCTS AND SERVICESOTHER INFORMATIONPRODUCTION, OPERATION AND SUPPLIER NETWORKOTHER INFORMATION 92 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE INTRODUCTION EMPLOYEE AND SOCIETY Adhering to our 4R principle (Reduction, Reuse, Recycling, Regeneration), BMW Brilliance actively seeks cooperation with our suppliers to enact compliant waste disposal measures and explore other ways to reduce resource waste. To this end, all of our potential waste han - dling suppliers must undergo an extensive evaluation process in order to be qualified and se - lected. For existing suppliers, we audit their documentation and continuously perform on-site inspections to ensure valid and proper disposal of all waste. In 2021, as a result of changes in waste classifications and improvements in various treatment processes, the waste-per-vehi - cle we sent off for disposal decreased from 2. 99 to 2. 50 kg per vehicle produced. WATER AND WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT We use reclaimed water generated from a wastewater treatment station for irrigation and cooling purposes. The capacity expansion work at Phase III also continues apace. The Paint Shop at Plant Tiexi has introduced new oily wastewater reduction technology to separate the oil component from the wastewater. This has resulted in the concentration volume of oily waste - water decreasing by 71, allowing us to save nearly 10 t month in water usage. BMW Brilliance has also initiated a host of strict routine water-conserving measures, in - cluding the use of water-efficient fixtures and posting water-saving signage throughout the production and office areas. In 2021, we achieved 1. 82 m3 of water used per vehicle, an improvement compared to 1. 97 m3 in 2020. Moreover, we have introduced grass planting bricks, clay water retainer layers and other ecological measures to ensure better soil and water conservation. In addition, more than 30 plant species will be introduced into our production facility via layered landscaping. BMW Brilliance s senior leadership takes overall responsibility and accountability for prevent - ing work-related injuries and ensuring safe and healthy workplaces for all employees. Our leadership team has developed OHS policies and objects to align with our strategic goals and ensures the effective operation and continual improvement of the system. The CEO ap - points the Head of Security, Occupational Safety and Services Department, as the Occupa - tional Health and Safety Management Representative to organise and further the operation of the OHS management system and advance a culture of safety throughout the company. The Designated OHS Management Coordinator, a senior manager from the Safety Manage - ment Department, serves as the second-in-command of this operation, supporting the OHS Management Representative in sustaining this important safety work.

This figure is publicised on the Corporate Average Fuel Consumption and New Energy Vehicle Credits of Passenger Vehicle Enterprises in 2021 by MIIT on April 8th 2022. Emissions from the upstream chain and disposal processes are based on the carbon footprint of representative vehicles from the BMW Group s product lines, calculated by Thinkstep s LCA tool GaBi which took into account Chinese market factors in the calculation. Leveraged on improved data traceability, we managed to track and report CO2 emissions from international inbound logistics (US-China route) in 2021. 3. The fleet emissions are extrapolated from the average fleet emissions of automobiles produced by BMW Brilliance for sales in mainland China market of the year. The calculation was based on an average mileage of 150, 000 km. The increase in business trip and the employees commuting in 2021 was mainly due to the recovery of business operation and employees commuting from COVID-19 s impact, as compared to 2020. 5. In addition to BMW Brilliance s Shenyang production base, as of 2021, BMW Brilliance ensured 100 renewable electricity use at its non-production sites. Total non-hazardous waste consists of non-hazardous waste for recycling and non-hazardous waste for disposal. We improved the data calculation process in 2020, and there was an increase in total non-hazardous waste for recycling over the previous year. Due to the improved data basis, the 2021 reporting scope of employees has been expanded to BMW Brilliance and its wholly- owned subsidiary LingYue Digital Information Technology Co., Ltd, including dispatched employees.

CRITERIA The criteria used by the Company to prepare the selected key data in the 2021 Sustainability Report is set out in the definitions of the key data in Chapter 5. 5 of the 2021 Sustainability Report (the basis of reporting ). THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT S RESPONSIBILITIES The Board of Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the selected key data in the 2021 Sustainability Report in accordance with the basis of reporting. This responsibility includes de - signing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation of the selected key data in the 2021 Sustainability Report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. OUR INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehen - sive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. PRACTITIONER S RESPONSIBILITIES It is our responsibility to express a conclusion on the selected key data in the 2021 Sustainability Re - port based on our work. We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Infor - mation. This standard requires that we plan and perform our work to form the conclusion. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Our work involves assessing the risks of material misstatement of the selected key data in the 2021 Sustainability Report whether due to fraud or error, and responding to the assessed risks. The extent of procedures selected depends on our judgment and assessment of the engage - ment risk. Within the scope of our work, we have performed the following procedures in Beijing Office, Tiexi Plant, Dadong Plant and Powertrain Plant of the Company 1.

RESTRICTION ON USE Our report has been prepared for and only for the board of management of the Company and for no other purpose. The calculation is based on the GB 27999-2019 Fuel Consumption Evaluation Methods and Targets for Passenger Cars of the People s Republic of China. The data is publicised on the website of the Ministry of Indus - try and Information Technology of the People s Republic of China on April 8th 2022. The coefficients used for calculation are from Emission Factors for Electricity, District Heating and Fuels issued by Application of German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA). Indirect CO2 emissions generated by the consumption of purchased electricity and purchased heating at the BMW Brilliance plants, excluding the purchased electricity and purchased heating consumption of construction and on- site suppliers. For calculation of the scope 2 CO2 emis - sions calculation, the market-based methodology is used in accordance with GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance issued by the World Resources Institute. Emission factors of the supply chain and the disposal are based on the carbon footprints of representative vehicles from the product lines, calculated by Thinkstep s LCA tool GaBi. Emis - sions factors of logistics are based on emission factors in DIN EN 16258. Emissions from the utilisation phase are calculated based on the average fleet emissions of automobiles produced by BMW Brilliance and an aver - age mileage of 150, 000 km per vehicle. Renewable electricity includes the generation of solar power electricity, the purchase of wind power electricity, and the International Renewable Energy Certificates (I-RECs).
