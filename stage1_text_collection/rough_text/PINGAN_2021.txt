Before the smart service platform was launched, there was a lack of environmental risks management service when insurance purchased. But now, by utilizing the platform, each applicant can reduce its costs in environmental management more than RMB 20, 000. 38 39 Ping An 2021 Sustainability Report Opening Sustainable Development Strategies and Management Feature on Responsibility Sustainable Business and Operations Appendix Green Development Achieve carbon neutrality in operations by 2030 Ping An strictly abides by laws and regulations, including the Environmental Protection Law of the People s Republic of China. From 2021 onwards, Ping An Group has deepened its work in green operations, built upon its past achievements and upgraded its goals. At present, Ping An is following the international frameworks including Science Based Target (SBTi) to explore its path to achieve carbon neutrality in operations by 2030. After implementing feasible internal and external emission reduction plans, Ping An will seek out other solutions, such as purchasing carbon sink, to eventually achieve carbon neutrality. Ping An Group s Operating Carbon Emissions Distribution Chart (Original Figure)Screening and Gradually Withdrawing from Brown Assets While continuously expanding its investment in green assets, Ping An will screen the size of the Group s brown assets and its generated carbon emissions, and plan to gradually reduce or withdraw from the investment in coal mining and thermal power plant projects. To this end, Ping An issued the latest Ping An Group's Policy Statement on Coal Business. Ping An Bank has tightened eligibility criteria for coal-related industries, such as thermal coal, coal-burning power generation, and steel by adopting more stringent conditions on installed capacity, coal consumption per unit of electricity, local restrictions etc. List-based management and rigorous quota management are also introduced. Through routine monitoring and one-on-one account approval, Ping An Bank urges its operating units to provide prioritized support for quality clients while phasing out risky clients with non-compliant production and lagging performance in environmental protection. Ping An Bank introduced green-oriented content into risk policies targeting carbon- intensive industries in order to maintain high quality clients and to contribute to carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals.

Ping An prudently provides companies in those sectors with loan, investment, and insurance products and services, and regularly reviews the impact of their asset portfolio on climate change. In response to China s strategic goals to peak carbon emissions and reach carbon neutrality, Ping An is committed to achieving carbon neutrality of its asset portfolios by 2060. Under this goal, it is necessary for Ping An to focus on limiting coal mining projects with low efficiency and high emission and coal-burning power projects. In principle, it is expected that Ping An will divest all unlisted projects such as direct equity or debt by the end of 2035 (except for projects achieved net-zero emissions). Proactive engagement and communication communicate with key carbon emission clients to make it clear that financial support needs to be linked to their transition path and goals. These companies will be asked to develop transition plans, such as the goal to decrease carbon intensity at a rate of no less than a certain percentage per year (the extent of control at different time stages is determined by the interval reduction rate in the carbon emission roadmap). At the same time, Ping An will support their transition financing through green bonds, green loans, as well as green asset securitization, and track their implementation over time. In conjunction with the Group s business layout, it has already carried out a series of activities based on carbon neutrality, including public welfare, digital village, and smart city management. On the basis of agricultural and renewable energy vehicle insurances, Ping An further developed insurance products and services, including corporate engineering insurance, carbon insurance, and premium service of risk management, and launched diverse profit concession plans that encompasses green enterprises, green projects, and non-green enterprises. Case Ping An Carbon Neutrality Green Finance Development Charitable Trust Coordinated by the Group, Ping An Trust, Ping An Puhui, and Ping An Leasing jointly established the first carbon neutral charitable trust in China. The charitable trust aims to promote the development of ecological civilization around the goal of carbon neutrality, including but not limited to funding, supporting, and promoting outstanding low-carbon projects; organizing relevant public welfare activities for green finance; and providing clean energy subsidies to the disadvantaged group in the form of funds and goods. After calculation and internal evaluation, Ping An Group's investment financial assets have a greater exposure to the transformation of the brown industry than the secured loan business, so the policy that declares withdrawal from the coal industry in 2035 is only applicable to investment at the beginning.
